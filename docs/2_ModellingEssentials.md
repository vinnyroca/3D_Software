> "Immersion in Osmose begins with the donning of the head-mounted display and motion-tracking vest. The first virtual space encountered is a three-dimensional Cartesian Grid which functions as an orientation space. With the immersant's first breaths, the grid gives way to a clearing in a forest. There are a dozen world-spaces in Osmose, most based on metaphorical aspects of nature. These include Clearing, Forest, Tree, Leaf, Cloud, Pond, Subterranean Earth, and Abyss. There is also a substratum, Code, which contains much of the actual software used to create the work, and a superstratum, Text, a space consisting of quotes from the artist and excerpts of relevant texts on technology, the body and nature. Code and Text function as conceptual parentheses around the worlds within."

> "During public installations of Ephémère, immersion takes place in a private chamber facing a large darkened space where museum visitors can witness the immersive performances as they take place in real time: aurally, as sound is generated by the participant’s behaviour within the work; and visually, as imagery generated from the immersant’s point-of-view is projected in real time onto a large-scale video screen. The shadow-silhouette of the immersant is projected live onto another screen, emphasizing the relationship between bodily presence and the immersive experience."

> "This is my first site-specific installation  It began as an installation for an artist run alternative space, Bliss House; subsequently it was also exhibited in a storefront at the Santa Monica Museum of Art. Both pieces ran simultaneously in different parts of the city. Viewers would drive across town to experience the entire installation. Issues surrounding the cultural specificity of gender in relation to domestic and corporate architecture were addressed by bifurcating the architecture and sites across town. A pair of animations were rear projected into the windows of two sites. A spinning polka-dot tunnel was positioned next to multiple orbiting earths. Ideas of the feminine and masculine in architecture were playfully manipulated in order to blur the distinctions between gender demarcations."

## Components of a Polygon Object

We've been talking in class about using Polygon primitives, basic shapes such as cubes and spheres, but what exactly is a **Polygon** objects.

In short, polygon objects are made up of three components:

- Vertices
- Edges
- Faces (sometimes called Polygons or Polys)

Before software like Maya, Polygon Models were made by manually entering the location of vertices into a computer. Often modelers and researchers would trace objects and use specialized equipment to find the distance between vertices.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/maya_VWBug.png"><figcaption>Image from Image Objects by Jacob Gaboury</figcaption></figure>

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/maya_SylvieGourand.png"><figcaption>Image from Image Objects by Jacob Gaboury</figcaption></figure>

Today, **Polygonal Modeling** involves manipulating these three components to create a wide variety of shapes. We are no longer limited to jamming polygon primitives together and now can create objects of our own design.

Let's start by loading the practice file for today's class. Download Here.

After the file is open, you'll notice on the right side of the screen there are a variety of layers.

Layers all us to store different models on different layers of our scene.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/maya_layers.png"></figure>

We can begin by turning on the visibility of our "FACES" layer by pressing the left-most button on the layer.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/maya_layers_on.png"></figure>

## Faces

To navigate to faces, hover over your model and press the **Right Mouse Button**.

This will bring up our [**Marking Menu**](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-8BA1A3AA-4C44-4779-8B22-0AAE3627E8EB). Marking Menus are context specific and allow us to get easy access to all the functionality of Maya.

You don't click in the marking menu. Instead, however over the tool you want to access and release the right mouse button.

> `UI TIP`: You can use the same marking menu to return to **Object Mode** when you are done selecting on faces.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_facemode.gif"></figure> 

### Modify

We can modify faces using the translate, rotate and scale tools.

Use the translate, rotate and scale tools to create the object on the right.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_modify.gif"></figure> 

### Delete

We can also delete faces to allow for interesting shapes.

Use the Translate and Delete tools to make the shape on the right.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_delete.gif"></figure> 

### Normals

Notice that the inside of our box is black, while the outside is gray.

This is because faces have not thickness to them, they are infinitely thin!
The direction the face is facing is the normal direction. We always want the normal direction to be facing outwards towards our camera.

We'll learn more about the complication of normals as the course progresses, but for now,
let's reverse the normals this model so that the inside of model is correctly facing the camera.

To select all the faces on our model:

1. Click on the model
2. Right click navigate to Face Mode
3. Press **Ctrl+Shift+A** to select all the faces.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_normal_select.gif"></figure> 

Next, we can press and hold **Shift+RMB** over our model. This will bring up a marking menu of contextual tools related to the component mode that we are in. In our case, it will bring up tools related to faces.

To reverse our normals:

1. Press and hold **Shift+RMB** over our model
2. Navigate to **Face Normals**
3. Navigate to **Reverse Normals**

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_normal_reverse.gif"></figure>

### Extrude

The most important tool associate with faces and for poly-modeling in general, is the **Extrude** tool. The extrude tool allows us to extrude out additional faces from our model to build out geometry.

We can open the extrude tool by using the **Shift+RightClick** marking menu and then navigating to **Extrude Face**.

#### Thickness

In the pop-up box for the tool, we can use the **Thickness** parameter to extrude the selected face. Let's use this parameter to match the model on the right.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_extrude_thickness.gif"></figure>

#### Offset

The **Offset** parameter allows us to inset our face. Let's use the extrude tool twice to make the model on the right.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_extrude_offset.gif"></figure>

#### Keep Faces Together

The **Keep Faces Together** parameter will allow us to extrude faces separately.
Extrude all the faces on the cube with **Keep Faces Together** off.

> `UI TIP`: Press **Ctrl+E** with a face selected to bring up the extrude tool.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_extrude_together.gif"></figure>

#### Hot Keys

Lastly, we can use the **Shift** Hot Key with our Translate, Rotate and Scale tools to quickly extrude.

Hold **Shift** while moving and scaling the top face to make the model on the right.

> `UI TIP:` If you have trouble rotating around face or seeing a face clearly, press the **F Key** on your keyboard to focus on a particular face. The clip below shows what happens when you zoom in on a face.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_extrude_hotkeys.gif"></figure>

#### Face Selection

Lastly, let's go over a common face selection technique. This allows us to select a large number of faces next to each other at once. Let's follow the below steps to make the model in the "face selection" area.

- Create a new cylinder in your scene and move it over to the "face selection" area. <br><figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_selection_newcylinder.gif"></figure>
> `UI TIP`:Use the **Shift+RMB** marking menu with nothing selected to quickly create new objects.


- Change the number of sides on your cylinder to 16 to match the object on the right.<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_selection_cylindersides.gif"></figure>
>`UI TIP`: We can change the amount of sides our cylinder has in the **Channel Box**.


- Next let's select everything but the top and bottom of our cylinder. We'll do this by selecting on face and then, hold **Shift**, double click on one of the faces next to our selected face. <figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_selection_cylinderselect.gif"></figure>

- Then, we'll press **Ctrl+Shift+I** to reverse the selection, followed by the **Delete Key** to delete our top and bottom faces.<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_selection_cylinderdelete.gif"></figure>

## Edges

Each face is typically made you of four edges. A face with four edges is refereed to as a quadrilateral or a "quad", for short. It is best practice when modeling to ensure allow your polygons are quads - in other words, each polygon should have four edges.

- 4 Sides, Quad = Great!
- 3 Sides, Tri = Okay in some situations. 
- 5+ Sides, N-Gon = Should rarely appear on model and will often cause errors

The structuring and flow of edges to create faces on a model is **topology**.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/maya_incredibles.png"><figcaption>Face Topology of Mrs.Incredible from The Incredibles. Notice on her ear we see what appears to be a tri. If we look closely, however, we can see it is actually a quad with four sides </figcaption></figure>

### Selecting Edges

To enter edge selection, we can hold the **Right Mouse Button** over our model and navigate up to edge.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_selection.gif"></figure>

Edges attached together in an unbroken line are called an **Edge Loop.**

We can select and edge loop by double click on an edge that is part of that loop.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_selection_edgeloop.gif"></figure>

Edges adjacent to each other, but not connecting in a loop, are called an **Edge Ring.**

We can select an edge ring by clicking on an edge and then **Shift+Double Click** on an adjacent edge. <figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_selection_edgering.gif"></figure>

To Delete an edge loop we use the special hotkey, **Ctrl+Backspace**. This hotkey will delete the edge loop and the vertices associated with it. Note in the gif below, we should not delete a single edge, as this will make and N-Gon. Instead, we should delete the whole edge loop.

Delete the center edge loop to match the image on the right.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_delete.gif"></figure>

### Modify

We can modify edges using our Transform, Rotate, Scale and Extrude tools.
Use the **Shift** Hot Key to extrude with Transform and Scale to create a model similar to the low polygon glass. Make sure to select the full edge loop at start.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_modify.gif"></figure>

Notice that our glass is one-sided, meaning, it has no interior. We can use the Extrude tool in Object mode to give some thickness to our glass.

We'll extrude inward to keep the profile of our glass the same, so we'll need to flip the normals of all our faces to be pointing outwards toward the camera. Make sure when you extrude the glass that the faces on the interior of the stem don't overlap.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_extrude.gif"></figure>

### Insert

We can add edge loops to our model using the **Insert Edge Loop Tool**. Hold **Shift+RMB** over the model and navigate to the Insert Edge Loop Tool. 

Hold Click + Drag on an edge to insert and position an edge loop. Release Left Click to place the edge loop. Insert edge loops to create the model on the right. Press Q to exit the insert edge loop tool.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_insert.gif"></figure>


We can also add edge loops to our model that are equally distant from one another. For this object, I want to be able to add in some basic windows and a door.

Lets start by opening the **Insert Edge Loop Tool** Settings. Hold **Shift+RMB** over the model and navigate to the small box next to the Insert Edge Loop Tool. This will bring up the tools settings.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_insert.gif"></figure>

In our settings, we can toggle on **Multiple Edge Loops** to insert a specific number of loops. Let's add 6 vertically and 7 Horizontally.

We can also extrude our windows and door to match the model on the right.

> `UI TIP`: When we turn on a tool such as Insert Edge Loop Tool, that tool stays on until we exit it. The easiest way to exit a tool is by pressing the Q key to activate the selection tool.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_insert_settings_building.gif"></figure>

### Bridge

Lastly, we have the bridge tool. The bridge tool allows us to create a face using two edges.

To use the bridge tool, we can click on two edges and navigate to **Bridge** holding **Shift+ Right Click**

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_bridge_single.gif"></figure>

We can bridge multiple edges together by selecting an equal number of edges opposite one another. Select the remaining six open edges and bridge them together.
