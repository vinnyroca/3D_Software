The first virtual space encountered is a three-dimensional Cartesian Grid which functions as an orientation space. With the immersant's first breaths, the grid gives way to a clearing in a forest. There are a dozen world-spaces in Osmose, most based on metaphorical aspects of nature. These include Clearing, Forest, Tree, Leaf, Cloud, Pond, Subterranean Earth, and Abyss. There is also a substratum, Code, which contains much of the actual software used to create the work, and a superstratum, Text, a space consisting of quotes from the artist and excerpts of relevant texts on technology, the body and nature. Code and Text function as conceptual parentheses around the worlds within."

The shadow-silhouette of the immersant is projected live onto another screen, emphasizing the relationship between bodily presence and the immersive experience."

Both pieces ran simultaneously in different parts of the city. Viewers would drive across town to experience the entire installation. Issues surrounding the cultural specificity of gender in relation to domestic and corporate architecture were addressed by bifurcating the architecture and sites across town. A pair of animations were rear projected into the windows of two sites. A spinning polka-dot tunnel was positioned next to multiple orbiting earths. Ideas of the feminine and masculine in architecture were playfully manipulated in order to blur the distinctions between gender demarcations."

## Components of a Polygon Object

We've been talking in class about using Polygon primitives, basic shapes such as cubes and spheres, but what exactly is a **Polygon** object.

In short, polygon objects are made up of three components:

- Vertices
- Edges
- Faces (sometimes called Polygons or Polys)

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_01.png"><figcaption>Face, Edge and Vertex</figcaption></figure>

Before software like Maya, Polygon Models were made by manually entering the location of vertices into a computer. Often, modelers and researchers would trace objects and use specialized equipment to find the distance between vertices.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/maya_VWBug.png"><figcaption>Image from Image Objects by Jacob Gaboury</figcaption></figure>

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/maya_SylvieGourand.png"><figcaption>Image from Image Objects by Jacob Gaboury</figcaption></figure>

Today, **Polygonal Modeling** involves manipulating these three components to create a wide variety of shapes. We are no longer limited to jamming polygon primitives together and now can create objects of our own design.

Let's start by loading the practice file for today's class. Download Here.

After the file is open, you'll notice on the right side of the screen that there are a variety of layers.

Layers allow us to store different models on different layers of our scene.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/maya_layers.png"></figure>

We can begin by turning on the visibility of our "FACES" layer by pressing the left-most button on the layer.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/maya_layers_on.png"></figure>

## Faces

To navigate to faces, hover over your model and press the **Right Mouse Button**.

This will bring up our [**Marking Menu**](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-8BA1A3AA-4C44-4779-8B22-0AAE3627E8EB). Marking Menus are context-specific and allow us to get easy access to all the functionality of Maya.

You don't click in the marking menu. Instead, however, over the tool you want to access and release the right mouse button.

> `UI TIP`: You can use the same marking menu to return to **Object Mode** when you are done selecting on faces.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_facemode.gif"></figure> 

### Modify

We can modify faces using the Move, Rotate and Scale tools.

Use the Move, Rotate and Scale tools to create the object on the right.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_modify.gif"></figure> 

### Delete

We can also delete faces to allow for interesting shapes.

Use the Move and Delete tools to make the shape on the right.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_delete.gif"></figure> 

### Normals

Notice that the inside of our box is black, while the outside is gray.

This is because faces have no thickness to them, they are infinitely thin!
The direction the face is facing is the normal direction. We always want the normal direction to be facing outwards towards our camera.

We'll learn more about the complications of normals as the course progresses, but for now,
let's reverse the normals this model so that the inside of the model is correctly facing the camera.

To select all the faces on our model:

1. Click on the model
2. Right click navigate to Face Mode
3. Press **Ctrl+Shift+A** to select all the faces.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_normal_select.gif"></figure> 

Next, we can press and hold **Shift+RMB** over our model. This will bring up a marking menu of contextual tools related to the component mode that we are in. In our case, it will bring up tools related to faces.

To reverse our normals:

1. Press and hold **Shift+RMB** over our model
2. Navigate to **Face Normals**
3. Navigate to **Reverse Normals**

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_normal_reverse.gif"></figure>

### Extrude

The most important tool associated with faces and for poly-modeling in general, is the **Extrude** tool. The extrude tool allows us to extrude additional faces from our model to build out geometry.

We can open the extrude tool by using the **Shift+RightClick** marking menu and then navigating to **Extrude Face**.

#### Thickness

In the pop-up box for the tool, we can use the **Thickness** parameter to extrude the selected face. Let's use this parameter to match the model on the right.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_extrude_thickness.gif"></figure>

#### Offset

The **Offset** parameter allows us to inset our face. Let's use the extrude tool twice to make the model on the right.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_extrude_offset.gif"></figure>

#### Keep Faces Together

The **Keep Faces Together** parameter will allow us to extrude faces separately.
Extrude all the faces on the cube with **Keep Faces Together** off.

> `UI TIP`: Press **Ctrl+E** with a face selected to bring up the extrude tool.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_extrude_together.gif"></figure>

#### Hot Keys

Lastly, we can use the **Shift** Hot Key with our Move, Rotate and Scale tools to quickly extrude.

Hold **Shift** while moving and scaling the top face to make the model on the right.

> `UI TIP:` If you have trouble rotating around a face or seeing a face clearly, press the **F Key** on your keyboard to focus on a particular face. The clip below shows what happens when you zoom in on a face.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_extrude_hotkeys.gif"></figure>

### Face Selection

Lastly, let's go over a common face selection technique. This allows us to select a large number of faces next to each other at once. Let's follow the below steps to make the model in the "face selection" area.

- Create a new cylinder in your scene and move it over to the "face selection" area. <br><figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_selection_newcylinder.gif"></figure>
> `UI TIP`:Use the **Shift+RMB** marking menu with nothing selected to quickly create new objects.


- Change the number of sides on your cylinder to 16 to match the object on the right.<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_selection_cylindersides.gif"></figure>
>`UI TIP`: We can change the number of sides our cylinder has in the **Channel Box**.


- Next let's select everything but the top and bottom of our cylinder. We'll do this by selecting on face and then, hold **Shift**, double click on one of the faces next to our selected face. <figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_selection_cylinderselect.gif"></figure>

- Then, we'll press **Ctrl+Shift+I** to reverse the selection, followed by the **Delete Key** to delete our top and bottom faces.<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_faces_selection_cylinderdelete.gif"></figure>

>`UI TIP`: **Shit+Click** to add items to your selection and **Ctrl+Click** to remove items from your selection, also works with face, edge and vertex selection.

## Edges

Each face is typically made you of four edges. A face with four edges is referred to as a quadrilateral or a "quad", for short. It is best practice when modeling to ensure allow your polygons are quads - in other words, each polygon should have four edges.

- 4 Sides, Quad = Great!
- 3 Sides, Tri = Okay in some situations. 
- 5+ Sides, N-Gon = Should rarely appear on model and will often cause errors

The structuring and flow of edges to create faces on a model is **topology**.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/maya_incredibles.png"><figcaption>Face Topology of Mrs.Incredible from The Incredibles. Notice on her ear we see what appears to be a tri. If we look closely, however, we can see it is actually a quad with four sides </figcaption></figure>

### Selecting Edges

To enter edge selection, we can hold the **Right Mouse Button** over our model and navigate up to **Edge**.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_selection.gif"></figure>

Edges attached together in an unbroken line are called an **Edge Loop.**

We can select an edge loop by double clicking on an edge that is part of that loop.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_selection_edgeloop.gif"></figure>

Edges adjacent to each other, but not connecting in a loop, are called an **Edge Ring.**

We can select an edge ring by clicking on an edge and then **Shift+Double Click** on an adjacent edge. <figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_selection_edgering.gif"></figure>

To Delete an edge loop, we use the special hotkey, **Ctrl+Backspace**. This hotkey will delete the edge loop and the vertices associated with it. Note in the gif below, we should not delete a single edge, as this will make an N-Gon. Instead, we should delete the whole edge loop.

Delete the center edge loop to match the image on the right.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_delete.gif"></figure>

### Modify

We can modify edges using our Transform, Rotate, Scale and Extrude tools.
Use the **Shift** Hot Key to extrude with Transform and Scale to create a model similar to the low polygon glass. Make sure to select the full edge loop at the start.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_modify.gif"></figure>

Notice that our glass is one-sided, meaning, it has no interior. We can use the Extrude tool in Object mode to give some thickness to our glass.

We'll extrude inward to keep the profile of our glass the same, so we'll need to flip the normals of all our faces to be pointing outwards toward the camera. Make sure when you extrude the glass that the faces on the interior of the stem don't overlap.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_extrude.gif"></figure>

### Insert

We can add edge loops to our model using the **Insert Edge Loop Tool**. Hold **Shift+RMB** over the model and navigate to the Insert Edge Loop Tool. 

Hold Click + Drag on an edge to insert and position an edge loop. Release Left Click to place the edge loop. Insert edge loops to create the model on the right. Press Q to exit the insert edge loop tool.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_insert.gif"></figure>


We can also add edge loops to our model that are equally distant from one another. For this object, I want to be able to add in some basic windows and a door.

Let's start by opening the **Insert Edge Loop Tool** Settings. Hold **Shift+RMB** over the model and navigate to the small box next to the Insert Edge Loop Tool. This will bring up the tools settings.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_insert_settings.gif"></figure>

In our settings, we can toggle on **Multiple Edge Loops** to insert a specific number of loops. Let's add 6 vertically and 7 horizontally.

We can also extrude our windows and door to match the model on the right.

> `UI TIP`: When we turn on a tool such as the Insert Edge Loop Tool, that tool stays on until we exit it. The easiest way to exit a tool is by pressing the **Q** key to activate the selection tool.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_insert_settings_building.gif"></figure>

### Bridge

Lastly, we have the bridge tool. The bridge tool allows us to create a face using two edges.

To use the bridge tool, we can click on two edges and navigate to **Bridge** holding **Shift+ Right Click**

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_bridge_single.gif"></figure>

We can bridge multiple edges together by selecting an equal number of edges opposite one another. Select the remaining six open edges and bridge them together.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/2_maya_edge_bridge_multiple.gif"></figure>

## Vertices

Vertices are an essential part of Polygon Modeling. **Vertices** define the end points of **edges** and the boundaries of **faces**.

In simple terms, vertices define our model. Take, for instance, the simple example of a cube. Each vertex of this cube is defined by its position in X,Y,Z space.


This is what our cube would look like if its back left corner were on the origin point.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_verticies_cube.png"></figure>

Behind the scenes, in the code of the 3D modeling software, the cube might look something a bit more like this:

``` python
 vertices = [
    (0, 0, 0),  # 0: origin (bottom-back-left)
    (1, 0, 0),  # 1: bottom-back-right
    (1, 1, 0),  # 2: top-back-right
    (0, 1, 0),  # 3: top-back-left
    (0, 0, 1),  # 4: bottom-front-left
    (1, 0, 1),  # 5: bottom-front-right
    (1, 1, 1),  # 6: top-front-right
    (0, 1, 1)   # 7: top-front-left
]

faces = [
    (0, 1, 2, 3),  # back face (Z = 0)
    (4, 5, 6, 7),  # front face (Z = 1)
    (0, 1, 5, 4),  # bottom face (Y = 0)
    (3, 2, 6, 7),  # top face (Y = 1)
    (1, 2, 6, 5),  # right face (X = 1)
    (0, 3, 7, 4)   # left face (X = 0)
]
```

> `THOUGHT`: Think back to the earlier image of the VW Bug being digitized. They entered in all of these X,Y,Z coordinates manually.


Here, our vertices are defined by X,Y,Z coordinates, and our faces are defined by grouping together those different vertices.

`When we manipulate our 3D model, we change how this model looks in code.`

With this in mind, we can do some interesting operations with vertices to create complex 3D models.

### Modify Vertices

Navigate to the Vertex selection tool by holding **RMB** over the first model and navigating to **Vertex**.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_vertices_selection.gif"></figure>

We can select multiple vertices by **Clicking + Dragging** over a number of vertices. Use this tool to select multiple vertices and manipulate them to match the model on the right. Make sure to hold **Shift** when selecting the second set of vertices.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_vertices_selection_box.gif"></figure>

### Weld

The most crucial modification tool we can use with vertices is the Weld tool. This allows us to merge two or more vertices together into a single vertex.

This operation allows us to create "water-tight" geometry so our edges and faces are connected.

Let's use some weld tools to make the model on the right.

#### Merge Vertices Tool

1. Begin by snapping the top open vertex of our cylinder to the top back vertex. Remember to use the **V Key** to activate Vertex snap. <figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_vertices_weld_snap.gif"></figure>
> `NOTE`: Even though the vertices are snapped together, they are still two separate vertices!
2. Let's keep track of how many vertices there are by turning on our Poly Count. Navigate to **Display** -> **Heads Up Display** -> **Poly Count**. This shows us how many Vertices, Edges, and Faces there are in our scene.<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_vertices_weld_polycount.gif"></figure> 
> `UI TIP`: The first number column shows the number of total components in our scene, the second column shows the object we have selected, and the third column shows us our current selection. You can see that if we select the area where we snapped our vertices together, there are **2** vertices. <figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_vertices_weld_polycount_selection.gif"></figure>
3. Let's merge these vertices into a single vertex using the **Merge Vertex** tool. Select the two vertices using the selection box, and use **Shift + RMB** to navigate to **Merge Vertices** -> **Merge Vertices**. For vertices that are right on top of each other, a safe **Distance Threshold** is **.001**. The **Distance Threshold** is how close the vertices need to be to each other to merge together. Most of the time **.01** is fine, you'll mostly be changing this number when merge vertices leads to unintended effects. <figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_vertices_weld_mergevertices.gif"></figure>
>`UI TIP`: When entering data into a dialog box in Maya, use the **Enter Key** on your keyboard to confirm the selection.
4. If we enter face selection and move one of our back top faces, we can see all of our faces are now properly connected. The below gif shows the difference between having our vertices merged versus not merged. <figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_vertices_weld_mergevertices_test.gif"></figure>

#### Target Weld Tool

The other tool that we can use when we want to move a vertex to merge with another is the **Target Weld Tool**. The target weld tool allows us to grab a vertex and snap it to another to weld them together.

1. Hold **Shift+RMB** on your model in Object selection mode and navigate to Target Weld Tool.<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_vertices_weld_targetweldtool.gif"></figure>
2. **Click + Drag** the bottom open vertex to the bottom center vertex to merge them together.<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_vertices_weld_targetweldtool_merge.gif"></figure>
3. Press **Q** to activate the selection tool and exit the Target Weld tool.

### Practice

Let's put what we've learned so far to the test by using two sides of a cube to make a complete cube.

1. Enter Edge selection mode and extrude and snap edges to make a full cube.
>`UI TIP`: When extruding using the **Shift** hot key, you can also hold a snapping too, such as **V** for vertex to extrude and snap.<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_vertices_practice_edges.gif"></figure>
2. Enter Vertex mode and use the Merge Vertex tool to merge all the vertices together. We may have forgotten which vertices are not merged, so we can select all of them using box selection.
>`UI TIP`: Box selection will select all vertices in its range, even those that are on the back of our model we can't see.<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_vertices_practice_merge.gif"></figure>

## Space and Transforms

Navigate to the "Additional" layer.

Before we move into our exercise for today, let's cover some important information about manipulating objects in 3D Software.

### World vs. Object vs. Component Space

#### World Space

You might have noticed that when we enter our Move tool, our gizmo always aligns with the direction of our world coordinates. Meaning Y is always Up, X is always Right, and Z is always forward. If, for example, I rotate my sphere slightly and then switch to the Move tool, my gizmo doesn't follow the rotation of my object; it instead follows the world.

This is known as **World Space**

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_world.gif"></figure>

#### Component Space

Component Space, instead, will match my gizmo to the *Normal Direction* of my component. Remember, normals are the direction a component faces forward.

For example, the normal direction of the vertices on a low poly sphere will look something like this:

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_normals.jpg"></figure>
Lets test out switching to component space and moving our vertices:

1. Select a vertex on the first sphere within the "Component Space" section and move it upward. Notice how it moves in world space. Press **Ctrl + Z** to undo the movement.<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_sphere_world.gif"></figure>
2. Make sure the Move tool is active and hold **Ctrl+Shift+RMB** to open the settings for our move tool. Notice how world is selected and navigate to "Component".<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_sphere_component_on.gif"></figure>
3. Now, move a vertex and note how it moves along the vertex's normal. Press **Ctrl + Z** to undo the movement.<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_sphere_component_vertex.gif"></figure>
4. Move the Vertices on the sphere to make the model on the right.<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_sphere_component_test.gif"></figure>

>`UI TIP`: Component space can also be used with faces and edges!

#### Object Space

Object space is similar to component space, but instead of following the specific normals, it follows the rotation of an object.

1. Navigate to the first cylinder in the "Object Space" section. Switch back to World Space and test the movement of your object. Then switch to Object Space and see its effects. Remember to hold **Ctrl+Shift+RMB** to switch between different spaces.<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_object_test.gif"></figure>
> `NOTE`: It appears that our gizmo doesn't change. However, on closer inspection, we can see it rotates 90 Degrees, matching the RotateY value in our Channel Box.

2. Looking at the bottom cylinder to the right within Object Space, we can see the gizmo matches the rotation of our object. Use the **V Key** to snap our the bottom cylinder to the top one, moving it in Object Space.<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_object_cylinder.gif"></figure>

### Combine

Let's say for those two cylinders, we wanted to merge them. If we tried, we would notice that nothing would happen. That is because we can only weld together two or more vertices that are on the same object. To combine two objects together to make one object, we can use the **Combine** tool.

- Snap the two cylinders together, select them both, and then hold **Shift+RMB** to open our object tools, then navigate to **Combine**.<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_combine.gif"></figure>
- Now, weld all the vertices together using the **Marge Vertices** tool. Navigate to the tool using **Shift+RMB** in vertex selection mode.<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_combine_merge.gif"></figure>

Notice that when we combine our cylinder, our Object Space transform matches our world coordinates. The Combine tool freezes our transformations, in other words, sets all of our channel box values to 0. Our object now has a rotation of 0, so the object space gizmo now matches perfectly with world space.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_combine_world.png"><figcaption>Our Object Space after combining<figcaption></figure>

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_combine_world_channel.png"><figcaption>Our Channel Box after combining<figcaption></figure>

### Freeze Transformations

We can manually freeze the transformation on an object by navigating to the Freeze Transformation tool. Select the first cylinder in the "Freeze Transformation" section then navigate to **Display** -> **Freeze Transformations**. Notice how the Channel Box values reset to 0.<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_freeze.gif"></figure>

### History

The last helpful thing to know about Maya before moving on to our exercise is **History**.

Everything in Maya is connected! Behind the scenes, every tool we used on our model connected through nodes and stored in our object's history. 

We can see this in our Channel Box:
<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_history_channel.png"></figure>

Or we can see it in our node editor.

We don't need to worry too much about the node editor for this class, but just to show you a bit of the back end of what is happening in Maya:

I made a new cube and deleted one face. You can see this in the node editor below:
<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_history_node.png"></figure>
I then combined the two cubes together, and made a mess like this, showing the two cubes combining:
<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_history_node_combine.png"></figure>
Finally, I deleted the History on my new model, essentially, all the past nodes so that now only my new object remains:
<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_history_node_history.png"></figure>

Let's combine the two cubes and delete their history.

1. Select both Cubes and combine them together.
<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_history_combine.gif"></figure>
2. Select the new object and navigate to **Edit** -> **Delete by Type** -> **History** 
<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_space_history_delete.gif"></figure>

`NOTE`: If something starts going wrong with your model, or tools begin acting strangely, it could be because the history of your model is influencing your current actions. It is good practice in Maya to occasionally delete the history of your model if you no longer need it!

## Class Exercise: Archway

To combine all the skills we learned today, we are going to be making this archway!

You can preview the final model by turning on the visibility of the "ARCH" layer.

>`NOTE`: There are many correct ways to make the same 3D model! This is just one way of many to make this archway.


1. Make a cylinder and use the channel box to give it 16 sides - enter the value in "Subdivision Axis"<br><br><figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_arch_1.gif"></figure>
1. Select all the sides of the cylinder by either using **Box Select** or by using the **Shift+Double Click** method mentioned within the Faces section.<br><br>Then invert the selection using **Ctrl+Shift+I** and delete the top and bottom faces. <br><br><figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_arch_2.gif"></figure>

## Independent Exercise: Tree

Inspired by the work of Char Davies and Jennifer Steinkamp, your exercise is to make 3D model of a tree. This exercise will be due at the start of the next class session. To complete this exercise, you'll need to learn some new tools on your own! Follow the tutorial below to get started!

*This tutorial will only demonstrate the fundamentals of creating a simple tree. Use what you learn in this tutorial to make a tree with a number of primary, secondary and tertiary branches.*

You can use a tree on campus for inspiration!

**Submit 3 screenshots and your Maya file on Canvas by the start of our next class session.**


### Getting Started

- Start by creating a cylinder with 24 sides. The reason we are starting with 24 sides is so we have enough room to create branches. 

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_01.gif"></figure>

- This will be our trunk. Let's delete the top and bottom faces. 

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_02.gif"></figure>

- Select the top edge loop and begin to extrude your model upward - scaling and rotating to give it some interesting shapes. 

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_03.gif"></figure>

### Making Primary Branches
- Extrude 2 segments that are around the same size and will be equal to the diameter of your new branch. Extrude once more to continue the trunk. 

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_04.gif"></figure>

- In the 2 segments we extruded, we want to extrude a new branch that has 16 sides. To do this we will select 12 faces: 6 on the top and 6 on the bottom. You can notice that the border of these selected faces has 16 sides. 

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_05.gif"></figure>

- Use the extrude tool to offset the faces by around **.1**.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_06.gif"></figure>

### Circularize Components

Circularize components is a very helpful tool with Maya. It allows us to take any components and average their shape into a circle. This is especially helpful for making our tree branches.

- With the offset faces selected, navigate holding **Shift+RMB** to **Circularize Components**.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_07.gif"></figure>

- You'll notice this will make somewhat of a mess. However, don't worry, we have learned the tools to clean it up! <br><br>Begin by opening up the Scale tool, and scaling the faces down using the center Gizmo.
<br><br> Then use the Rotate tool to match the edges beyond the circle to flow with the rest of our topology.<br><br>Finally, use the Move tool to pull out the circle slightly.

> `NOTE`: You may need to be in **Component Space** for the Move, Rotate, and Scale tool to have the intended effects.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_08.gif"></figure>

- Delete the faces and begin extruding out the edge loop to make a new branch. You may notice you need to adjust the scale of your edge loops.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_09.gif"></figure>

### Making Secondary Branches

- To make secondary branches, we can repeat the same process of using primary branches. However, instead of selecting 12 faces to make a branch with 16 sides, we will instead select 8 polygons to make a branch with 12 Sides.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_10.gif"></figure>

### Making Tertiary Branches

- To make tertiary branches, we'll repeat the same process, except we will only select 6 faces to make branches with 8 sides.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_11.gif"></figure>

### Duplicating Branches

Since we are doing all this work to make a single branch, it would be great to learn how to duplicate this work to other parts of our model.

- Begin by creating a new hole in our model, similar to the size of the branch we want to duplicate.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_12.gif"></figure>

- Select all the faces of the branch we want to duplicate.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_13.gif"></figure>

- With the faces selected, navigate holding **Shift+RMB** to Duplicate Face. This will make a new object based on the faces we selected.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_14.gif"></figure>

- Select our new object and move it up. If you select our original model first, double click on the model to select our new object. Double clicking will swap between models that are on top of each other. 

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_15.gif"></figure>

-  Snap the pivot point of our new model to be on a vertex on the base of our branch.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_16.gif"></figure>

- Move our new branch to be aligned with the new hole we created.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_17.gif"></figure>

- Combine the two objects together.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_18.gif"></figure>

- Either using the bridge tool or the move vertices tool, join the two branches together.

<figure> <img src = "../assets/images/02_maya_tree_19.gif"></figure>

### Smooth Shading

You might notice that we can see all the edges of our model. This makes our model look less like a tree. We can make our model appear smoother by softening the edges on our model. This will smooth the transition between different faces of our model.

- To soften our edges, in object mode navigate holding **Shift + RMB** to **Soften/Harden Edges** -> **Soften Edge.**
