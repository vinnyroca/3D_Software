# Response: Software Studies

For this reading response, we will be considering 3D Software through the lens of software studies.

For this response:

1. Read pages 1 - 33 of *Getting to Know Software: A Study of Autodesk Maya*(2015)  by Aylish Wood
2. Watch *[RGBFAQ](https://alanwarburton.co.uk/rgbfaq)* by Alan Warburton

Discussion prompts:
 
 - How does Wood's description of Maya compare to your experience thus far? Do you notice the ways in which Maya's UI is directing your thinking or approach to making?
 - Have you had an experience with any other software in which you noticed it's design was shaping your thinking and behaviors?
 - What does studying software allow us to understand about our culture and politics?
 - Would you consider Alan Warburton's video work a piece of software studies? Although not specific to one program, what do you think about the software he is speaking about and the conclusions he draws?
 - Does Warburton's video change how you think about the role of 3D images? How has this role evolved from the earlier images we say in the film *Computer Dreams*.
