## Course Description

This interdisciplinary introductory course examines the history, theory, and techniques of 3D software. Through weekly assignments, critical readings, and projects, students will engage with 3D software as a technical tool, artistic medium, and cultural object. This course introduces foundational skills in modeling, rendering, and animation using Maya and Zbrush, alongside exploration of additional software. Weekly discussions, readings, and presentations will critically engage with 3D software’s cultural, social, economic, and political dimensions. The ideas and skills taught in this course will set a foundation for future coursework in game design, animation, video art, digital fabrication, and media studies.

## Learning Outcomes

The objective of this course is to introduce foundational technical skills in 3D software and contextualize this knowledge within the cultural,  social, economic, and political impact of modeling, rendering, and animation technologies. Through projects, assignments, discussions, reading responses, technical tutorials, and lectures, students will achieve the following learning outcomes:

- Technical proficiency in modeling, rendering, and animating using 3D software.
- Ability to analyze the role of 3D software in media art.
- Ability to analyze software as cultural, historical, and technical objects.
- Gain critical knowledge of history, theory, and cultural impact of 3D software.
- Ability to craft expansive media art projects using 3D software.

## Course Outline

#### 1. Introduction  

#### 2. Modeling Software 

In this module, students will be introduced to the fundamentals of Autodesk Maya. Additionally, students will be provided an overview of the field of software studies, with a particular focus on the study of media production software.  

#### 3. Modeling History  

In this module, we will look at the origins of 3D modeling research and software. We will explore how this early history continues to shape 3D modeling and our understanding of digital objects. Further, we will continue our exploration of the techniques of modeling by looking at how we can manipulate components to create more complex 3D models.

#### 4. Modeling Vision  

In this module, we will explore how space, materials, and objects are understood by processes of computation and software. We will compare this computational process to our experiences of the world to consider the drawbacks and affordances of the imperfect simulation of 3D software for artists. We will develop technical and critical knowledge for discussing how this historically situated and imperfect simulation continues to impact our culture in the present. Additionally, we will make use of historical technical standardizations within Maya to learn about texturing and image-based modeling.  


#### 5. Modeling Objects  

In this module, we will explore how the history of modeling objects has shaped both further computer graphics research as well as our contemporary understanding of digital objects. We will explore the disconnect in 3D modeling between geometry and material to explore 3D modeling as an imperfect simulation. Additionally, we will continue to develop our technical skills by learning the fundamentals of creating materials and producing rendered images of our 3D scenes.  

#### 6. Modeling Artists  

#### <mark>7. PROJECT ONE CRIT</mark>  

#### 8. Modeling Knowledge  

In this module, we will explore how models in the academy, from protein models to detailed models of Rome, have changed how knowledge is formed and produced. We will consider how we can use models to generate knowledge, as well as explore the limitations and criticisms of conducting knowledge experiments with software. We will also consider how 3D modeling has been used as a tool of resistance to protect vulnerable communities. Additionally, we will begin experimenting with ZBrush to explore the potential of organic modeling to create abstract and representational models.

#### **Evaluation Criteria**
##### Projects and Assignments

|||
|:---:|---|
|Technique| Is the assignment well-crafted? Is the conceptual idea behind the assignment supported by the technical and artistic decisions made by the student?|
|Concept|Does the student comprehend the scope of the assignment? Is the student able to communicate their ideas clearly? Does the student demonstrate comprehension of the concepts covered in class? Is the student able to articulate the concepts behind their work?|
|Generosity|Does the student exhibit insight, criticality, and risk-taking in their work? How much sensitivity and critical insight does the student display towards personal assignments and in critiquing their peers’ work?|

#### Participation

As this course includes in-person discussions and critiques, active participation and attendance make up 20 percent of students’ final grade. All students are required to participate actively during the discussion periods, which will be facilitated using each student’s reading responses.

Students more than ten minutes late for class will be marked as late. Three late marks will result in an unexcused absence. More than two unexcused absences may, at the instructor’s discretion, affect the final participation grade.

All critique and presentation classes are mandatory. If you anticipate missing a critique or presentation class or expect to have more than two absences during the course, inform the instructor as soon as possible.

#### Reading Responses

Reading responses will be graded on the level of engagement the student has with the text. Is the student connecting the text to other readings or experiences? Is the student engaging with the text through questions, disagreements, or new lines of thought?

As reading responses are essential to the discussion section of the course, late reading responses will not be accepted.

#### Artist Presentations

Artist presentations will be evaluated on the group’s research, comprehensiveness, and clarity of the oral presentation. Does the research demonstrate that the students carried out extensive research practices when exploring the artist’s biography and practice? Does the student use the themes of the course to contextualize the artist’s work within 3D software? Do the students include citations for the sources of their presentation?
