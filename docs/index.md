## Course Description

This interdisciplinary introductory course examines the history, theory, and techniques of 3D software. Through weekly assignments, critical readings, and projects, students will engage with 3D software as a technical tool, artistic medium, and cultural object. This course introduces foundational skills in modeling, rendering, and animation using various software. Weekly discussions, readings, and presentations will critically engage with 3D software’s cultural, social, economic, and political dimensions. The ideas and skills taught in this course will set a foundation for future coursework in game design, animation, video art, digital fabrication, and media studies.

## Learning Outcomes

The objective of this course is to introduce foundational technical skills in 3D software and contextualize this knowledge within the cultural,  social, economic, and political impact of modeling, rendering, and animation technologies. Through projects, assignments, discussions, reading responses, technical tutorials, and lectures, students will achieve the following learning outcomes:

- Technical proficiency in modeling, rendering, and animating using 3D software.
- Ability to analyze the role of 3D software in media art.
- Ability to analyze software as cultural, historical, and technical objects.
- Gain critical knowledge of history, theory, and cultural impact of 3D software.
- Ability to craft expansive media art projects using 3D software.

#### **Evaluation Criteria**
#### Projects and Assignments

|||
|:---:|---|
|Technique| Is the assignment well-crafted? Is the conceptual idea behind the assignment supported by the technical and artistic decisions made by the student?|
|Concept|Does the student comprehend the scope of the assignment? Is the student able to communicate their ideas clearly? Does the student demonstrate comprehension of the concepts covered in class? Is the student able to articulate the concepts behind their work?|
|Generosity|Does the student exhibit insight, criticality, and risk-taking in their work? How much sensitivity and critical insight does the student display towards personal assignments and in critiquing their peers’ work?|

#### Participation

As this course includes in-person discussions and critiques, active participation and attendance make up 20 percent of students’ final grade. All students are required to participate actively during the discussion periods, which will be facilitated using each student’s reading responses.

Students more than ten minutes late for class will be marked as late. Three late marks will result in an unexcused absence. More than two unexcused absences may, at the instructor’s discretion, affect the final participation grade.

All critique and presentation classes are mandatory. If you anticipate missing a critique or presentation class or expect to have more than two absences during the course, inform the instructor as soon as possible.

#### Reading Responses

Reading responses will be graded on the level of engagement the student has with the text. Is the student connecting the text to other readings or experiences? Is the student engaging with the text through questions, disagreements, or new lines of thought?

As reading responses are essential to the discussion section of the course, late reading responses will not be accepted.

#### Artist Presentations

Artist presentations will be evaluated on the group’s research, comprehensiveness, and clarity of the oral presentation. Does the research demonstrate that the students carried out extensive research practices when exploring the artist’s biography and practice? Does the student use the themes of the course to contextualize the artist’s work within 3D software? Do the students include citations for the sources of their presentation?
