> "This is my first site-specific installation  It began as an installation for an artist run alternative space, Bliss House; subsequently it was also exhibited in a storefront at the Santa Monica Museum of Art. Both pieces ran simultaneously in different parts of the city. Viewers would drive across town to experience the entire installation. Issues surrounding the cultural specificity of gender in relation to domestic and corporate architecture were addressed by bifurcating the architecture and sites across town. A pair of animations were rear projected into the windows of two sites. A spinning polka-dot tunnel was positioned next to multiple orbiting earths. Ideas of the feminine and masculine in architecture were playfully manipulated in order to blur the distinctions between gender demarcations."
