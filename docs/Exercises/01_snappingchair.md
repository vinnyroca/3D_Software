# Precise Chair Exercise

## Tutorial 

Using the chair from the simple chair exercise, we can snap parts of our model together.

Our goal is to change our pivot point in such a way that we can align the corner of our chair leg with the corner of our chair base. <figure><img src = "/assets/images/maya_chair_leg_pivot_corner.png" ><figcaption>The Two corners we want to align</figcaption></figure>

1. Let's move our chair leg down to make some more space. <img src = "/assets/images/maya_chair_leg_pivot_down.gif" >
2. Press the **D Key** on your keyboard to bring up our pivot controls.<img src = "/assets/images/maya_chair_leg_pivot_activate.gif" >
3. To snap our pivot to the corner of our leg we can hold down on the **V Key** on our keyboard (short for vertex, which will get to next class). And click and drag on the yellow center of our pivot to move it to the proper corner.<img src = "/assets/images/maya_chair_leg_pivot_corner.gif" >
4. We can turn off the pivot tool using the **D Key**, make sure our Move tool is on and press and hold the **V Key** again to snap our object to the bottom corner of our base by clicking and dragging on the center of our Move gizmo.<img src = "/assets/images/maya_chair_leg_pivot_snap.gif" >
5. Let's repeat these steps with the other parts of our chair.<img src = "/assets/images/maya_chair_leg_pivot_finalchair.gif">
6. See if you can snap the back of the chair in place!
