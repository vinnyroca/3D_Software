# Modeling a Simple Chair

1. Create a Cube and name it "base."
1. Scale and Move the base object of your chair to become a seat.<figure><img src = "/assets/images/maya_chair_base.gif" > </figure>
2. Let's create a new cube using our **Poly Modeling Shelf** and name it "Leg" within our Outliner.
3. Scale and move your new cube to be in the position of a chair leg.<figure><img src = "/assets/images/maya_chair_leg.gif" > </figure>
4. We can now duplicate this leg. We can do this by clicking on our leg, activating the Move tool with the **W Key** and then holding **Shift** and dragging on an axis.<img src = "/assets/images/maya_chair_leg_duplication.gif" >
5. You might now notice it is hard to see the edges of your different objects. In our view panel, we can display the edges of our model. This is the "wire frame on shaded" view mode.<img src = "/assets/images/maya_chair_edges.gif" >
6. Now let's use another method of duplication or cloning for our legs. **Click** and then **Shift+Click** on the other leg. <img src = "/assets/images/maya_chair_multi_select.gif" >
>`UI TIP`: You can use **Shift + Click** to add objects to your selection. You can also use **Ctrl+Click** to remove objects from your current selection.
1. Then press **Ctrl+D** on your keyboard to duplicate the two models and drag them over to the correct position.<img src = "/assets/images/maya_chair_leg_back.gif" >
2. Finally, lets click on our base, press **Ctrl+D** to duplicate it. Than Rotate it while holding the **J Key** to snap it 90 Degrees before moving it to the back of our chair.<img src = "/assets/images/maya_chair_back.gif" >
