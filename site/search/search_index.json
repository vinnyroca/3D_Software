You can navigate to the search menu on the bottom of your screen and search for \"Maya.\" Maya Loading Screen This will open you to the Maya homepage, where we can create a new project by pressing new. You might notice that we need to keep tabbing back and forth between our tutorial and our Maya interface. Since in the lab we are only using one monitor, let's use Windows' default split screen feature to create a divided screen. Click on the top bar of your Maya interface and hold the Windows Key and then tap the Left Arrow Key. Release the Windows Key and you should then see the option to click our Browser to have the two screens side by side. By clicking and dragging on the dividing line between the two screens you can change the amount of your screen each window takes up. This class website has flexible scaling so feel free to make the browser as small as you like. I recommended you scale the browser to still see the left navigation bar. We'll be using this technique for the remainder of this class, so refer back to this section if you forget the order of operations. Maya Interface My Maya interface Although the Maya interface seems very confusing at first, as we move through the course, you will notice that your navigation of buttons and menus will become more intuitive. Our readings for this introductory module will introduce software studies through an examination of Maya's interface. To keep things simple, we will cover parts of the interface as needed for different parts of the course. As a continuous reminder, as an experimental arts course, we are not looking for technical mastery , we are looking to understand Maya/3D software in general artistically and critically. View Panel In the center of our screen, we have our view panel . This is where we can view 3D objects and manipulate them in real time. Thought: Although we are just starting, begin to consider the relationship between the view panel, which shows a live 3D view, and the various data points around this central portion. How is a 3D model both represented as a real-time image and data? You might see four view panels as shown below: Four view panels If you do not see four panels, hover over your main panel and tap the space key. Each of these view panels represents a different way of viewing our model. To make things easier, lets create a basic 3D model (called a polygon primitive ) to see how an object appears in each view port. Click on the icon of the cube within the Poly Modeling Shelf located in the upper right corner of your screen. In the center of our screen, we should now see our cube four, each time from a slightly different perspective. Each of these view ports represents a different way of viewing our model. Four view panels with Cube (I have zoomed in on the cube slightly) We can infer what each of these view panels are displaying based on the name at the bottom of each quadrant. The image below shows the name of the perspective view port (persp). While the other view panels show the cube from the top, front and side position using orthographic projection. We'll learn a bit more about the technology of projection later on in the course but what we need to know for now is that these view panels are showing the two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional object. Perspective Projection: a method for projecting a 3D object onto a 2D picture plane to approximate how a 3D object might be viewed by a camera IRL. Orthographic Projection: a method for projecting an 3D object to make all lines parallel. You might think for now of isometric projection used in many video games or architectural drawings. Isometric Projection in Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 - Image: Giant Bomb Now that we have a slight understanding of what we are looking at in our view panel, let's begin to dive into the relationship between our object and our scene. Cartesian Coordinate Space You might remember from your math classes learning about unit space, or what is more formally known as Cartesian Coordinate space (named after Ren\u00e9 Descartes). This is a simple coordinate system where, generally, each whole number is marked in a grid structure. You can see a simple example below with some points marked using the common (x,y) notation with x being the horizontal axis and y being the vertical axis. The important thing to know here is that Maya, and all 3D programs, make use of this coordinate space to visualize the location of models within our scene. The only difference from the image above is that instead of making use of a 2D x,y space, in Maya we use a 3D (x,y,z) space. In our Maya interface, we should see four view panels. Let's hover over our Perspective view panel and tap the space key to maximize this panel. We should see our cube highlighted with a green outline. If not, we can click on our cube. Finally, press the W Key on your keyboard. We'll talk more shortly about what this hot key does. This should show the Gizmo on our cube. UI TIP: Press the + or - key to change the size of your gizmo The Red Arrow points in the direction of the positive X Axis , the Blue Arrow , the positive Z Axis , and the Green Arrow , the positive Y Axis . NOTE: Different 3D software represent the coordinate space differently. While Maya uses the Y Axis to represent the vertical direction, some software use the Z Axis. What we can infer is that our cube, being in the center of our grid, is at the (0,0,0) position, also known as the origin point. We can see a numerical representation of our object in the coordinate space by looking at our Channel Box . Channel Box The Channel Box with our Cube selected. Our cube is named pCube1 (the first polygon cube in our scene!) The Channel Box is UI panel that allows us to quickly see information about our model. The Channel Box is most commonly used in animation to edit various aspects about our models quickly, but it is also a great descriptor of basic information about our model. We can notice that our Channel Box is separated into different values: Translate : The position of our object (corresponds to Move tool). Rotate : The rotation of our object. Scale : The size of our object. Visibility : Whether or not our object is visible in the scene (we'll touch on this later in the course.) To start, try inputting some values into of of the Translate Channels to see how it affects our Cube. UI TIP: If you click on a channel such as TranslateX and see it highlight, you can click and drag your middle mouse key to smoothly change the values of the channel. Notice how changing the channel values of Translate directly affects the position of our object within our scene. Now let's try the opposite. Make sure you can still see the move gizmo on your cube by clicking on your cube and pressing the W Key . Then, click and drag on one of the arrows to move your cube in the view panel. Notice how the corresponding channel values change as you move your cube. Translating our Cube UI TIP: If you click and drag on the plane between two axis, this will move your object along two axes simultaneously. Also notice that our last click axis is highlighted yellow. By clicking on this highlighted plane, we can move our object along multiple axes Now, that we have moved our object around a bit, we might notice that it is hard to see how our object is exactly moving from our single viewing perspective. Let's return our Cube to the origin point by entering in 0 for Translate X,Y, and Z in our channel box and begin to discuss view panel navigation. Navigating around our View Panels One of the most important UI interactions with Maya in navigating around the 3D space of our perspective view panel. Luckily, view port navigation in Maya is quite simple and only uses our Alt Key and Mouse Buttons . ZOOM (Alt + RMB): First, let's try zooming into our cube. Hold the Alt Key and Right Mouse Button and begin dragging in the vertical or horizontal direction. You will notice that dragging on the positive Y and positive X zoom us out, while dragging on the negative Y and negative X zoom us in. Zooming In and Out ROTATE (Alt + LMB): Next, let's try rotating around our cube. Hold the Alt Key and Left Mouse Button and begin dragging in the vertical or horizontal direction. Notice the different behaviors between dragging vertically and horizontally. Rotating around our Cube PAN (Alt + MMB): Lastly, let's try panning around our scene. Hold the Alt Key and Middle Mouse Button and begin dragging in the vertical or horizontal direction. Panning allows us to focus on different parts of our scene. Panning around our Scene UI TIP: If you loose track of your object in your scene or if you want to focus on a particular object, you can click on any give object and press the F Key to focus on that object. When you focus on an object and then rotate your camera, you will notice that the camera will rotate around the particular focused object. NOTE: What is actually happening behind the scenes when we pan, rotate and zoom, is that we are moving a camera called \"persp\" (from which our View Panel gets its name) changing the properties of this camera. You can click on this camera in the left side of your screen in the Outliner (which we will cover shortly) and edit properties such as the Focal Length of your persp camera in the Channel Box. persp camera made visible! NOTE: In our orthographic view panels, we are only able to pan and zoom. Essential Object Manipulation Now that we know the relationship between our object, the coordinate system and the channel box, as well as how to navigate around our view port, we can now discuss basic object manipulation using Move , Rotate and Scale . Move (W): We have already covered a bit about move, but now lets go in a bit deeper to learn what this tool actually does. If we click on our cube and again press the W Key we can notice that one of the menus on the left highlights. Tool bar showing our Selection, Move, Rotate and Scale Tools Although we can click on this button on the left, it is best practice to begin memorizing essential Maya hot keys. Try translating using the gizmo while also rotating and panning your camera. Rotation (E): We can also rotate objects in our scene by pressing the E Key on our keyboard to bring up our rotation gizmo. By click and dragging on a particular axis, we can rotate our object. Notice in our Channel Box we are rotating our object in terms of Degrees . If we enter 45 in RotateY in our channel box, our cube with turn 45 Degrees around its Y Axis. UI TIP: By pressing and holding the J Key before rotating, we can precisely rotate our object by 15 Degree increments. Scale (R): Lastly, we have scale. This allows us to change the size of our object. Lets reset all our channel box values by entering zero for all translate and rotate channels. UI TIP: If you want to change the value of more than one channel in your channel box, you can click and then shift click to select all the values your want to change. Then enter the value you want all the channels to have and press enter. Below, I click on TranslateX then shift click on RotateZ and then enter 0 to reset all channel values. Now we can press the R Key to bring up our scale tool. We can notice in our Channel Box, the scale values by default are equal to 1. This value works as a multiplier. For example, a scale value of 2 will be twice our original scale. UI TIP: Notice that the Move, Rotate and Scale tool are all next to each other on your keyboard. Allowing easy access between the tools using W, E, and R. NOTE: By default Maya uses centimeters for its unit of measurement. Thus, our cube is currently 1cm by 1cm by 1cm. By changing a scale channel value to 2, our object would then be 2 cm on the particular axis. Our grid coordinate by default also uses centimeters. We can scale our object uniformly by clicking and dragging on the yellow cube in the center of our scale gizmo. Notice all all Scale Channel values change by the same amount. We can also scale our object on each axis by clicking and dragging on an axis of the scale gizmo. UI TIP: If we don't want to see our Move, Rotate, and Scale gizmos, we can press the Q Key on our keyboard to change to our selection tool (also right next to our Move, Rotate, and Scale tools on our keyboard). Outliner Before we move onto playing around with making some basic models using objects, let's talk about how we can keep track of objects within our scene. First, let's clean up our scene by deleting our original cube. Click on your Cube and then press the Delete Key on your keyboard. Then lets add in a new cube using the Poly Modeling Shelf . Notice that when we add in the cube a new object appears in our Outliner on the left side of our screen. The Outliner lists all of our objects within our scene. Notice we have all of our cameras as well as our newly created \"pCube1\". We can also rename our objects within our Outliner by double click on the name of our object. Lets rename our cube to \"Base\" The Outliner can be used for finding objects within our scene as well as selecting objects by clicking on them. Modeling a Basic Chair Although we are not really diving into the complexities of model today, let's use what we have learned in class so far to build a basic chair. Scale and Move the base object of your chair to become a seat. Let's create a new cube using our Poly Modeling Shelf and name it \"Leg\" within our Outliner. Scale and move your new cube to be in the position of a chair leg. We can now duplicate this leg. We can do this by clicking on our leg, activating the Move tool with the W Key and then holding Shift and dragging on an axis. You might now notice it is hard to see the edges of your different objects. In our view panel, we can display the edges of our model. This is the \"wire frame on shaded\" view mode. Now let's use another method of duplication or cloning for our legs. Click and then Shift+Click on the other leg. UI TIP : You can use Shift + Click to add objects to your selection. You can also use Ctrl+Click to remove objects from your current selection. Then press Ctrl+D on your keyboard to duplicate the two models and drag them over to the correct position. Finally, lets click on our base, press Ctrl+D to duplicate it. Than Rotate it while holding the J Key to snap it 90 Degrees before moving it to the back of our chair. Pivot Points and Snapping Now that we have made our chair you might notice that things are looking a bit wonky! This is okay, 3D models don't always need to be precise. However, since our focus today is on learning the basics before we break them, lets get a bit more precise with how we are moving our objects in our scene. To do this, we will make use of the pivot point and snapping . If we click on one of the legs our our chair and activate our Move tool, well notice that the pivot point of this object is in the very center. The pivot point is the position where our object moves, rotates and scales. By moving this pivot point we can change how our object behaves. Pivot point at the center of the chair's leg Our goal is to change our pivot point in such a way that we can align the corner of our chair leg with the corner of our chair base. The Two corners we want to align To do this, we'll need to move our pivot point to be on the correct corner of our leg, then align that to be at the corner of the base of our chair. Moving Our Pivot and Snapping Let's move our chair leg down to make some more space. Press the D Key on your keyboard to bring up our pivot controls. To snap our pivot to the corner of our leg we can hold down on the V Key on our keyboard (short for vertex, which will get to next class). And click and drag on the yellow center of our pivot to move it to the proper corner. We can turn off the pivot tool using the D Key , make sure our Move tool is on and press and hold the V Key again to snap our object to the bottom corner of our base by clicking and dragging on the center of our Move gizmo. Finally, let's repeat these steps with the other parts of our chair.

NOTE: Different 3D software represent the coordinate space differently. While Maya uses the Y Axis to represent the vertical direction, some software use the Z Axis. What we can infer is that our cube, being in the center of our grid, is at the (0,0,0) position, also known as the origin point. We can see a numerical representation of our object in the coordinate space by looking at our Channel Box .","title":"Cartesian Coordinate Space"},{"location":"1_MayaInterface/#channel-box","text":"The Channel Box with our Cube selected. Our cube is named pCube1 (the first polygon cube in our scene!) The Channel Box is UI panel that allows us to quickly see information about our model. The Channel Box is most commonly used in animation to edit various aspects about our models quickly, but it is also a great descriptor of basic information about our model. We can notice that our Channel Box is separated into different values: Translate : The position of our object (corresponds to Move tool). Rotate : The rotation of our object. Scale : The size of our object. Visibility : Whether or not our object is visible in the scene (we'll touch on this later in the course.) To start, try inputting some values into of of the Translate Channels to see how it affects our Cube. UI TIP: If you click on a channel such as TranslateX and see it highlight, you can click and drag your middle mouse key to smoothly change the values of the channel. Notice how changing the channel values of Translate directly affects the position of our object within our scene. Now let's try the opposite. Make sure you can still see the move gizmo on your cube by clicking on your cube and pressing the W Key . Then, click and drag on one of the arrows to move your cube in the view panel. Notice how the corresponding channel values change as you move your cube. Translating our Cube UI TIP: If you click and drag on the plane between two axis, this will move your object along two axes simultaneously. Also notice that our last click axis is highlighted yellow. By clicking on this highlighted plane, we can move our object along multiple axes Now, that we have moved our object around a bit, we might notice that it is hard to see how our object is exactly moving from our single viewing perspective.

In short, polygon objects are made up of three components: Vertices Edges Faces (sometimes called Polygons or Polys) Face, Edge and Vertex Before software like Maya, Polygon Models were made by manually entering the location of vertices into a computer. Often, modelers and researchers would trace objects and use specialized equipment to find the distance between vertices. Image from Image Objects by Jacob Gaboury Image from Image Objects by Jacob Gaboury Today, Polygonal Modeling involves manipulating these three components to create a wide variety of shapes. We are no longer limited to jamming polygon primitives together and now can create objects of our own design. Let's start by loading the practice file for today's class. Download Here. After the file is open, you'll notice on the right side of the screen that there are a variety of layers. Layers allow us to store different models on different layers of our scene. We can begin by turning on the visibility of our \"FACES\" layer by pressing the left-most button on the layer. Faces To navigate to faces, hover over your model and press the Right Mouse Button . This will bring up our Marking Menu . Marking Menus are context-specific and allow us to get easy access to all the functionality of Maya. You don't click in the marking menu. Instead, however, over the tool you want to access and release the right mouse button. UI TIP : You can use the same marking menu to return to Object Mode when you are done selecting on faces. Modify We can modify faces using the Move, Rotate and Scale tools. Use the Move, Rotate and Scale tools to create the object on the right. Delete We can also delete faces to allow for interesting shapes. Use the Move and Delete tools to make the shape on the right. Normals Notice that the inside of our box is black, while the outside is gray. This is because faces have no thickness to them, they are infinitely thin! The direction the face is facing is the normal direction. We always want the normal direction to be facing outwards towards our camera. We'll learn more about the complications of normals as the course progresses, but for now, let's reverse the normals this model so that the inside of the model is correctly facing the camera. To select all the faces on our model: Click on the model Right click navigate to Face Mode Press Ctrl+Shift+A to select all the faces. Next, we can press and hold Shift+RMB over our model. This will bring up a marking menu of contextual tools related to the component mode that we are in. In our case, it will bring up tools related to faces. To reverse our normals: Press and hold Shift+RMB over our model Navigate to Face Normals Navigate to Reverse Normals Extrude The most important tool associated with faces and for poly-modeling in general, is the Extrude tool. The extrude tool allows us to extrude additional faces from our model to build out geometry. We can open the extrude tool by using the Shift+RightClick marking menu and then navigating to Extrude Face . Thickness In the pop-up box for the tool, we can use the Thickness parameter to extrude the selected face. Let's use this parameter to match the model on the right. Offset The Offset parameter allows us to inset our face. Let's use the extrude tool twice to make the model on the right. Keep Faces Together The Keep Faces Together parameter will allow us to extrude faces separately. Extrude all the faces on the cube with Keep Faces Together off. UI TIP : Press Ctrl+E with a face selected to bring up the extrude tool. Hot Keys Lastly, we can use the Shift Hot Key with our Move, Rotate and Scale tools to quickly extrude. Hold Shift while moving and scaling the top face to make the model on the right. UI TIP: If you have trouble rotating around a face or seeing a face clearly, press the F Key on your keyboard to focus on a particular face. The clip below shows what happens when you zoom in on a face. Face Selection Lastly, let's go over a common face selection technique. This allows us to select a large number of faces next to each other at once. Let's follow the below steps to make the model in the \"face selection\" area. Create a new cylinder in your scene and move it over to the \"face selection\" area. UI TIP :Use the Shift+RMB marking menu with nothing selected to quickly create new objects. Change the number of sides on your cylinder to 16 to match the object on the right. UI TIP : We can change the number of sides our cylinder has in the Channel Box . Next let's select everything but the top and bottom of our cylinder. We'll do this by selecting on face and then, hold Shift , double click on one of the faces next to our selected face. Then, we'll press Ctrl+Shift+I to reverse the selection, followed by the Delete Key to delete our top and bottom faces. UI TIP : Shit+Click to add items to your selection and Ctrl+Click to remove items from your selection, also works with face, edge and vertex selection. Edges Each face is typically made you of four edges. A face with four edges is referred to as a quadrilateral or a \"quad\", for short. It is best practice when modeling to ensure allow your polygons are quads - in other words, each polygon should have four edges. 4 Sides, Quad = Great! 3 Sides, Tri = Okay in some situations. 5+ Sides, N-Gon = Should rarely appear on model and will often cause errors The structuring and flow of edges to create faces on a model is topology . Face Topology of Mrs.Incredible from The Incredibles. Notice on her ear we see what appears to be a tri. If we look closely, however, we can see it is actually a quad with four sides Selecting Edges To enter edge selection, we can hold the Right Mouse Button over our model and navigate up to Edge . Edges attached together in an unbroken line are called an Edge Loop. We can select an edge loop by double clicking on an edge that is part of that loop. Edges adjacent to each other, but not connecting in a loop, are called an Edge Ring. We can select an edge ring by clicking on an edge and then Shift+Double Click on an adjacent edge. To Delete an edge loop, we use the special hotkey, Ctrl+Backspace . This hotkey will delete the edge loop and the vertices associated with it. Note in the gif below, we should not delete a single edge, as this will make an N-Gon. Instead, we should delete the whole edge loop. Delete the center edge loop to match the image on the right. Modify We can modify edges using our Transform, Rotate, Scale and Extrude tools. Use the Shift Hot Key to extrude with Transform and Scale to create a model similar to the low polygon glass. Make sure to select the full edge loop at the start. Notice that our glass is one-sided, meaning, it has no interior. We can use the Extrude tool in Object mode to give some thickness to our glass. We'll extrude inward to keep the profile of our glass the same, so we'll need to flip the normals of all our faces to be pointing outwards toward the camera. Make sure when you extrude the glass that the faces on the interior of the stem don't overlap. Insert We can add edge loops to our model using the Insert Edge Loop Tool . Hold Shift+RMB over the model and navigate to the Insert Edge Loop Tool. Hold Click + Drag on an edge to insert and position an edge loop. Release Left Click to place the edge loop. Insert edge loops to create the model on the right. Press Q to exit the insert edge loop tool. We can also add edge loops to our model that are equally distant from one another. For this object, I want to be able to add in some basic windows and a door. Let's start by opening the Insert Edge Loop Tool Settings. Hold Shift+RMB over the model and navigate to the small box next to the Insert Edge Loop Tool. This will bring up the tools settings. In our settings, we can toggle on Multiple Edge Loops to insert a specific number of loops. Let's add 6 vertically and 7 horizontally. We can also extrude our windows and door to match the model on the right. UI TIP : When we turn on a tool such as the Insert Edge Loop Tool, that tool stays on until we exit it. The easiest way to exit a tool is by pressing the Q key to activate the selection tool. Bridge Lastly, we have the bridge tool. The bridge tool allows us to create a face using two edges. To use the bridge tool, we can click on two edges and navigate to Bridge holding Shift+ Right Click We can bridge multiple edges together by selecting an equal number of edges opposite one another. Select the remaining six open edges and bridge them together. Vertices Vertices are an essential part of Polygon Modeling. Vertices define the end points of edges and the boundaries of faces . In simple terms, vertices define our model. Take, for instance, the simple example of a cube. Each vertex of this cube is defined by its position in X,Y,Z space. This is what our cube would look like if its back left corner were on the origin point. Behind the scenes, in the code of the 3D modeling software, the cube might look something a bit more like this: vertices = [ (0, 0, 0), # 0: origin (bottom-back-left) (1, 0, 0), # 1: bottom-back-right (1, 1, 0), # 2: top-back-right (0, 1, 0), # 3: top-back-left (0, 0, 1), # 4: bottom-front-left (1, 0, 1), # 5: bottom-front-right (1, 1, 1), # 6: top-front-right (0, 1, 1) # 7: top-front-left ] faces = [ (0, 1, 2, 3), # back face (Z = 0) (4, 5, 6, 7), # front face (Z = 1) (0, 1, 5, 4), # bottom face (Y = 0) (3, 2, 6, 7), # top face (Y = 1) (1, 2, 6, 5), # right face (X = 1) (0, 3, 7, 4) # left face (X = 0) ] THOUGHT : Think back to the earlier image of the VW Bug being digitized. They entered in all of these X,Y,Z coordinates manually. Here, our vertices are defined by X,Y,Z coordinates, and our faces are defined by grouping together those different vertices. When we manipulate our 3D model, we change how this model looks in code. With this in mind, we can do some interesting operations with vertices to create complex 3D models. Modify Vertices Navigate to the Vertex selection tool by holding RMB over the first model and navigating to Vertex . We can select multiple vertices by Clicking + Dragging over a number of vertices. Use this tool to select multiple vertices and manipulate them to match the model on the right. Make sure to hold Shift when selecting the second set of vertices. Weld The most crucial modification tool we can use with vertices is the Weld tool. This allows us to merge two or more vertices together into a single vertex. This operation allows us to create \"water-tight\" geometry so our edges and faces are connected. Let's use some weld tools to make the model on the right. Merge Vertices Tool Begin by snapping the top open vertex of our cylinder to the top back vertex. Remember to use the V Key to activate Vertex snap. NOTE : Even though the vertices are snapped together, they are still two separate vertices! Let's keep track of how many vertices there are by turning on our Poly Count. Navigate to Display -> Heads Up Display -> Poly Count . This shows us how many Vertices, Edges, and Faces there are in our scene. UI TIP : The first number column shows the number of total components in our scene, the second column shows the object we have selected, and the third column shows us our current selection. You can see that if we select the area where we snapped our vertices together, there are 2 vertices. Let's merge these vertices into a single vertex using the Merge Vertex tool. Select the two vertices using the selection box, and use Shift + RMB to navigate to Merge Vertices -> Merge Vertices . For vertices that are right on top of each other, a safe Distance Threshold is .001 . The Distance Threshold is how close the vertices need to be to each other to merge together. Most of the time .01 is fine, you'll mostly be changing this number when merge vertices leads to unintended effects. UI TIP : When entering data into a dialog box in Maya, use the Enter Key on your keyboard to confirm the selection. If we enter face selection and move one of our back top faces, we can see all of our faces are now properly connected. The below gif shows the difference between having our vertices merged versus not merged. Target Weld Tool The other tool that we can use when we want to move a vertex to merge with another is the Target Weld Tool . The target weld tool allows us to grab a vertex and snap it to another to weld them together. Hold Shift+RMB on your model in Object selection mode and navigate to Target Weld Tool. Click + Drag the bottom open vertex to the bottom center vertex to merge them together. Press Q to activate the selection tool and exit the Target Weld tool. Practice Let's put what we've learned so far to the test by using two sides of a cube to make a complete cube. Enter Edge selection mode and extrude and snap edges to make a full cube. UI TIP : When extruding using the Shift hot key, you can also hold a snapping too, such as V for vertex to extrude and snap. Enter Vertex mode and use the Merge Vertex tool to merge all the vertices together. We may have forgotten which vertices are not merged, so we can select all of them using box selection. UI TIP : Box selection will select all vertices in its range, even those that are on the back of our model we can't see. Space and Transforms Navigate to the \"Additional\" layer. Before we move into our exercise for today, let's cover some important information about manipulating objects in 3D Software. World vs. Object vs. Component Space World Space You might have noticed that when we enter our Move tool, our gizmo always aligns with the direction of our world coordinates. Meaning Y is always Up, X is always Right, and Z is always forward. If, for example, I rotate my sphere slightly and then switch to the Move tool, my gizmo doesn't follow the rotation of my object; it instead follows the world. This is known as World Space Component Space Component Space, instead, will match my gizmo to the Normal Direction of my component. Remember, normals are the direction a component faces forward. For example, the normal direction of the vertices on a low poly sphere will look something like this: Lets test out switching to component space and moving our vertices: Select a vertex on the first sphere within the \"Component Space\" section and move it upward. Notice how it moves in world space. Press Ctrl + Z to undo the movement. Make sure the Move tool is active and hold Ctrl+Shift+RMB to open the settings for our move tool. Notice how world is selected and navigate to \"Component\". Now, move a vertex and note how it moves along the vertex's normal. Press Ctrl + Z to undo the movement. Move the Vertices on the sphere to make the model on the right. UI TIP : Component space can also be used with faces and edges! Object Space Object space is similar to component space, but instead of following the specific normals, it follows the rotation of an object. Navigate to the first cylinder in the \"Object Space\" section. Switch back to World Space and test the movement of your object. Then switch to Object Space and see its effects. Remember to hold Ctrl+Shift+RMB to switch between different spaces. NOTE : It appears that our gizmo doesn't change. However, on closer inspection, we can see it rotates 90 Degrees, matching the RotateY value in our Channel Box. Looking at the bottom cylinder to the right within Object Space, we can see the gizmo matches the rotation of our object. Use the V Key to snap our the bottom cylinder to the top one, moving it in Object Space. Combine Let's say for those two cylinders, we wanted to merge them. If we tried, we would notice that nothing would happen. That is because we can only weld together two or more vertices that are on the same object. To combine two objects together to make one object, we can use the Combine tool. Snap the two cylinders together, select them both, and then hold Shift+RMB to open our object tools, then navigate to Combine . Now, weld all the vertices together using the Marge Vertices tool. Navigate to the tool using Shift+RMB in vertex selection mode. Notice that when we combine our cylinder, our Object Space transform matches our world coordinates. The Combine tool freezes our transformations, in other words, sets all of our channel box values to 0. Our object now has a rotation of 0, so the object space gizmo now matches perfectly with world space. Our Object Space after combining Our Channel Box after combining Freeze Transformations We can manually freeze the transformation on an object by navigating to the Freeze Transformation tool. Select the first cylinder in the \"Freeze Transformation\" section then navigate to Display -> Freeze Transformations . Notice how the Channel Box values reset to 0. History The last helpful thing to know about Maya before moving on to our exercise is History . Everything in Maya is connected! Behind the scenes, every tool we used on our model connected through nodes and stored in our object's history. We can see this in our Channel Box: Or we can see it in our node editor. We don't need to worry too much about the node editor for this class, but just to show you a bit of the back end of what is happening in Maya: I made a new cube and deleted one face. You can see this in the node editor below: I then combined the two cubes together, and made a mess like this, showing the two cubes combining: Finally, I deleted the History on my new model, essentially, all the past nodes so that now only my new object remains: Let's combine the two cubes and delete their history. Select both Cubes and combine them together. Select the new object and navigate to Edit -> Delete by Type -> History NOTE : If something starts going wrong with your model, or tools begin acting strangely, it could be because the history of your model is influencing your current actions. It is good practice in Maya to occasionally delete the history of your model if you no longer need it! Class Exercise: Archway To combine all the skills we learned today, we are going to be making this archway! You can preview the final model by turning on the visibility of the \"ARCH\" layer. NOTE : There are many correct ways to make the same 3D model! This is just one way of many to make this archway. Make a cylinder and use the channel box to give it 16 sides - enter the value in \"Subdivision Axis\" Select all the sides of the cylinder by either using Box Select or by using the Shift+Double Click method mentioned within the Faces section. Then invert the selection using Ctrl+Shift+I and delete the top and bottom faces. Rotate the cylinder 90 degrees along the X Axis. Hold the J key while rotating to snap to 15 degree increments. Enter face mode, and delete the bottom half of our cylinder. Use the scale tool in object mode to make it thinner along the Z Axis. Select the center 8 edges on the outside of our arch and extrude them along the Y Axis. The scale tool can also be used to flatten edges to a common height With the top 8 edges selected, scale the edges along the Y Axis to make them level. Our normals are facing the wrong direction! Enter face mode, select all the faces using Ctrl+Shift+A , and navigate holding Shift+RMB to Face Normals -> Reverse Normals We want to extrude the sides of our arch. Our model is symmetrical so we can turn on Symmetry to carry out the same operations on both sides of our model. Select your model and make sure the move tool is active. Holding Shift+Ctrl+RMB to open up the setting for our move tool. Navigate to Symmetry Make sure the following are checked on. World (the space of our symmetry) X Axis (the Axis on which we want symmetry to happen) Symmetry (activates our Symmetry tool) UI TIP : At the top of your View Panel, you can see if symmetry is active. Extrude the side edges of our arch along the X Axis. Scale the sides along the X Axis to make the level Select the top edges on one of our newly extruded sides. Extrude along the Y Axis and snap them to the top vertices of our model. Select all the vertices of our model using Ctrl+Shift+A Use the Merge Vertices tool to merge them together. Using the Bridge tool, bridge the sides of our arch together. Double click an edge part of the top edge loop. Deselect the two edges on the side. Using the Bridge tool, bridge the top of our arch together. Select the edge loop on the bottom of our arch. Extrude along the Y Axis. Bridge the bottom of our arch. Snap the Pivot point of our model to the bottom-most vertices. Place on model on the origin point of our world. Duplicate our arch by dragging the move tool on the Z Axis while holding Shift Move the pivot point of this new model to be on the front left bottom corner (see gif below) Rotate the new arch by 90 degrees along the Y Axis. Snap it to the bottom corner of our original arch. Duplicate the new arch and snap it to our original arch. Using the Combine tool, combine our arches together. With Symmetry still on, delete the interior faces of the corner of our archway. Select and Merge all vertices. Extrude the sides of our arch and snap them to the front vertices along the Z Axis. Bridge the front of our model. Bridge the top and bottom of our model. We are going to use a new tool, the Mirror tool, to complete our model. start by deleting the unedited half of our archway. Snap our pivot to the back-most vertices of our model. Then snap the pivot to the bottom-most vertices. Finally, snap the model to the center of our grid. Let's prepare our model for the Mirror tool by deleting its history. Select our model and navigate to Edit -> Delete by Type -> History Select our model in Object mode. Holding Shift+RMB activate the Mirror tool. This tool allows us to reflect and weld our model along a certain axis. Make sure you change the following parameters: Axis Position = World (changes the space in which of model reflects). Axis = Z (changes the Axis over which our model reflects) Merge Threshold = .01 (minimum distance for our vertices to marge together) Finally, let's clean up our model by deleting its history and freezing its transformations. To Delete History - Edit -> Delete by Type -> History . To Freeze Transformations - Modify -> Freeze Transformations Readings For Discussion For our discussion on Thursday September 4th, we will be readings selections from Chapter 1 of Aylish Wood. Independent Exercise: Tree Inspired by the work of Char Davies and Jennifer Steinkamp, your exercise is to make 3D model of a tree. This exercise will be due at the start of the next class session. To complete this exercise, you'll need to learn some new tools on your own! Follow the tutorial below to get started! This tutorial will only demonstrate the fundamentals of creating a simple tree. Use what you learn in this tutorial to make a tree with a number of primary, secondary and tertiary branches. You can use a tree on campus for inspiration! Submit 3 screenshots and your Maya file on Canvas by the start of our next class session. Getting Started Start by creating a cylinder with 24 sides. The reason we are starting with 24 sides is so we have enough room to create branches. This will be our trunk. Let's delete the top and bottom faces. Select the top edge loop and begin to extrude your model upward - scaling and rotating to give it some interesting shapes. Making Primary Branches Extrude 2 segments that are around the same size and will be equal to the diameter of your new branch. Extrude once more to continue the trunk. In the 2 segments we extruded, we want to extrude a new branch that has 16 sides. To do this we will select 12 faces: 6 on the top and 6 on the bottom. You can notice that the border of these selected faces has 16 sides. Use the extrude tool to offset the faces by around .1 . Circularize Components Circularize components is a very helpful tool with Maya. It allows us to take any components and average their shape into a circle. This is especially helpful for making our tree branches. With the offset faces selected, navigate holding Shift+RMB to Circularize Components . You'll notice this will make somewhat of a mess. However, don't worry, we have learned the tools to clean it up! Begin by opening up the Scale tool, and scaling the faces down using the center Gizmo. Then use the Rotate tool to match the edges beyond the circle to flow with the rest of our topology. Finally, use the Move tool to pull out the circle slightly. NOTE : You may need to be in Component Space for the Move, Rotate, and Scale tool to have the intended effects. Delete the faces and begin extruding out the edge loop to make a new branch. You may notice you need to adjust the scale of your edge loops. Making Secondary Branches To make secondary branches, we can repeat the same process of using primary branches. However, instead of selecting 12 faces to make a branch with 16 sides, we will instead select 8 polygons to make a branch with 12 Sides. Making Tertiary Branches To make tertiary branches, we'll repeat the same process, except we will only select 6 faces to make branches with 8 sides. Duplicating Branches Since we are doing all this work to make a single branch, it would be great to learn how to duplicate this work to other parts of our model. Begin by creating a new hole in our model, similar to the size of the branch we want to duplicate. Select all the faces of the branch we want to duplicate. With the faces selected, navigate holding Shift+RMB to Duplicate Face. This will make a new object based on the faces we selected. Select our new object and move it up. If you select our original model first, double click on the model to select our new object. Double clicking will swap between models that are on top of each other. Snap the pivot point of our new model to be on a vertex on the base of our branch. Move our new branch to be aligned with the new hole we created. Combine the two objects together. Either using the bridge tool or the move vertices tool, join the two branches together. Smooth Shading You might notice that we can see all the edges of our model. This makes our model look less like a tree. We can make our model appear smoother by softening the edges on our model. This will smooth the transition between different faces of our model. To soften our edges, in object mode navigate holding Shift + RMB to Soften/Harden Edges -> Soften Edge.","title":"2 ModellingEssentials"},{"location":"2_ModellingEssentials/#polygonal-modelling-with-maya","text":"RECAP: What we learned last class: How to Navigate Around the UI of Maya How to Create basic Polygon objects in Maya (called Polygon Primitives!)

Everything in Maya is connected! Behind the scenes, every tool we used on our model connected through nodes and stored in our object's history. We can see this in our Channel Box: Or we can see it in our node editor. We don't need to worry too much about the node editor for this class, but just to show you a bit of the back end of what is happening in Maya: I made a new cube and deleted one face. You can see this in the node editor below: I then combined the two cubes together, and made a mess like this, showing the two cubes combining: Finally, I deleted the History on my new model, essentially, all the past nodes so that now only my new object remains: Let's combine the two cubes and delete their history. Select both Cubes and combine them together. Select the new object and navigate to Edit -> Delete by Type -> History NOTE : If something starts going wrong with your model, or tools begin acting strangely, it could be because the history of your model is influencing your current actions. It is good practice in Maya to occasionally delete the history of your model if you no longer need it!","title":"History"},{"location":"2_ModellingEssentials/#class-exercise-archway","text":"To combine all the skills we learned today, we are going to be making this archway! You can preview the final model by turning on the visibility of the \"ARCH\" layer. NOTE : There are many correct ways to make the same 3D model! This is just one way of many to make this archway. Make a cylinder and use the channel box to give it 16 sides - enter the value in \"Subdivision Axis\" Select all the sides of the cylinder by either using Box Select or by using the Shift+Double Click method mentioned within the Faces section. Then invert the selection using Ctrl+Shift+I and delete the top and bottom faces. Rotate the cylinder 90 degrees along the X Axis. Hold the J key while rotating to snap to 15 degree increments. Enter face mode, and delete the bottom half of our cylinder. Use the scale tool in object mode to make it thinner along the Z Axis. Select the center 8 edges on the outside of our arch and extrude them along the Y Axis. The scale tool can also be used to flatten edges to a common height With the top 8 edges selected, scale the edges along the Y Axis to make them level. Our normals are facing the wrong direction! Enter face mode, select all the faces using Ctrl+Shift+A , and navigate holding Shift+RMB to Face Normals -> Reverse Normals We want to extrude the sides of our arch. Our model is symmetrical so we can turn on Symmetry to carry out the same operations on both sides of our model. Select your model and make sure the move tool is active. Holding Shift+Ctrl+RMB to open up the setting for our move tool. Navigate to Symmetry Make sure the following are checked on. World (the space of our symmetry) X Axis (the Axis on which we want symmetry to happen) Symmetry (activates our Symmetry tool) UI TIP : At the top of your View Panel, you can see if symmetry is active. Extrude the side edges of our arch along the X Axis. Scale the sides along the X Axis to make the level Select the top edges on one of our newly extruded sides. Extrude along the Y Axis and snap them to the top vertices of our model. Select all the vertices of our model using Ctrl+Shift+A Use the Merge Vertices tool to merge them together. Using the Bridge tool, bridge the sides of our arch together. Double click an edge part of the top edge loop. Deselect the two edges on the side. Using the Bridge tool, bridge the top of our arch together. Select the edge loop on the bottom of our arch. Extrude along the Y Axis. Bridge the bottom of our arch. Snap the Pivot point of our model to the bottom-most vertices. Place on model on the origin point of our world. Duplicate our arch by dragging the move tool on the Z Axis while holding Shift Move the pivot point of this new model to be on the front left bottom corner (see gif below) Rotate the new arch by 90 degrees along the Y Axis. Snap it to the bottom corner of our original arch. Duplicate the new arch and snap it to our original arch. Using the Combine tool, combine our arches together. With Symmetry still on, delete the interior faces of the corner of our archway. Select and Merge all vertices. Extrude the sides of our arch and snap them to the front vertices along the Z Axis. Bridge the front of our model. Bridge the top and bottom of our model. We are going to use a new tool, the Mirror tool, to complete our model. start by deleting the unedited half of our archway. Snap our pivot to the back-most vertices of our model. Then snap the pivot to the bottom-most vertices. Finally, snap the model to the center of our grid. Let's prepare our model for the Mirror tool by deleting its history. Select our model and navigate to Edit -> Delete by Type -> History Select our model in Object mode. Holding Shift+RMB activate the Mirror tool. This tool allows us to reflect and weld our model along a certain axis. Make sure you change the following parameters: Axis Position = World (changes the space in which of model reflects). Axis = Z (changes the Axis over which our model reflects) Merge Threshold = .01 (minimum distance for our vertices to marge together) Finally, let's clean up our model by deleting its history and freezing its transformations.

To Freeze Transformations - Modify -> Freeze Transformations","title":"Class Exercise: Archway"},{"location":"2_ModellingEssentials/#readings-for-discussion","text":"For our discussion on Thursday September 4th, we will be readings selections from Chapter 1 of Aylish Wood.","title":"Readings For Discussion"},{"location":"2_ModellingEssentials/#independent-exercise-tree","text":"Inspired by the work of Char Davies and Jennifer Steinkamp, your exercise is to make 3D model of a tree. This exercise will be due at the start of the next class session. To complete this exercise, you'll need to learn some new tools on your own! Follow the tutorial below to get started! This tutorial will only demonstrate the fundamentals of creating a simple tree. Use what you learn in this tutorial to make a tree with a number of primary, secondary and tertiary branches. You can use a tree on campus for inspiration!

It allows us to take any components and average their shape into a circle. This is especially helpful for making our tree branches. With the offset faces selected, navigate holding Shift+RMB to Circularize Components . You'll notice this will make somewhat of a mess. However, don't worry, we have learned the tools to clean it up! Begin by opening up the Scale tool, and scaling the faces down using the center Gizmo. Then use the Rotate tool to match the edges beyond the circle to flow with the rest of our topology. Finally, use the Move tool to pull out the circle slightly. NOTE : You may need to be in Component Space for the Move, Rotate, and Scale tool to have the intended effects. Delete the faces and begin extruding out the edge loop to make a new branch. You may notice you need to adjust the scale of your edge loops.","title":"Circularize Components"},{"location":"2_ModellingEssentials/#making-secondary-branches","text":"To make secondary branches, we can repeat the same process of using primary branches.

With the faces selected, navigate holding Shift+RMB to Duplicate Face. This will make a new object based on the faces we selected. Select our new object and move it up. If you select our original model first, double click on the model to select our new object. Double clicking will swap between models that are on top of each other.

A dream object can be anything. It could quite literally be an object from your dreams, a normal object turned strange and disturbing, or it might be an object of your own lucid invention. Perhaps, it is a device that only you can operate. Perhaps, it is a familiar object distorted through memories. Perhaps, it is an object you are trying to remember. Perhaps, it lives in a mountain far away, as large as a Red Wood tree, silently recording the patterns of constellations. If a dream object is anything, however, it is not a normal object. It is not a basketball, or a cup, or a shoe, or a house, or a boat, or a gun. If it was a real thing, it has changed. It has become something else; or, it was never recognizable at all. To decide on your dream object, think of its context. We will be taking inspiration from Victor Burgin's Afterlife . What do we notice about Afterlife ? It consists of \"pages.\" It consists of text. It consists of images. Some rendered, some not rendered. But, what is most important is that the text contextualizes the images, and the images contextualize the text. Separate, they point to two different directions. Together, they create a context. It should be noted, Victor Burgin is a serious guy, very serious. We look to him for form and structure, but his tone is not a requirement. Your final assignment will have text and it will have images. Some of those images will be rendered. Others, if you would like others, might be photographs, scans, or any other set of pixels. Using whatever text and image editing software you like, be it Photoshop, InDesign, PowerPoint, or others, you will create a PDF of any dimensions. In this PDF, some pages will be empty. In this PDF, some pages will have images. Some pages will have text. No page will have both. At least 5 of these pages will have renders of your dream object. In other words, you will need to produce 5 renders of your dream object for this assignment. Each of these renders will be different, and describe something different about your dream object. If you wish to create other additional renders of places or other objects, do not stop yourself. At least 4 of these pages should have text. As for the text, it might: describe a story, tell a lie, give us commands, state a prayer, describe a dance, or anything in between. But, importantly, the text and images together will form a context. At least two of the pages should be blank. Use these blank pages thoughtfully. Some housekeeping: there should be a title page. (You may refuse this last requirement if you like.) Some options on how to begin: Dream, see and record what emerges. Don't dream, see and record what emerges. Daydream, see and record what emerges. Write some words, see what images emerge. Think of some images, see what words emerge. Think of you standing there, you are holding this thing in your hand, or, perhaps it is a thing in front you, larger than the horizon, or, perhaps it is as small as a pea, right under your foot. Oh no, it's attacking someone. Oh wait, it's not moving at all. Oh look, it is trying to tell you something. Oh wait, it cannot speak. This thing is your dream object. Another context: This class. We have just learned the fundamentals of hard surface modeling. Creatively, this gives us limitations. There are many things we do not know how to do, yet there are many things we already know how to make. Start there, start with what we have learned and what we know. What can you make? How can you make that more complex, interesting, inspiring, disturbing, compelling? With this in mind, like all things, this assignment will be made one step at a time, piece by piece. Periodically, we will share these pieces (more information on that below). However, there is one rule. And, under no circumstances should this rule be broken: Up until our critique day, in which we will all gather and share what we have been working on, your text, and thus your context, will be a secret. We might see your dream object, examine its textures, but we will not know its world, its story, its ambitions, or its dreams. Up until our crit, it is a dream of your own to ponder, build, and imagine. Pieces Initial Drawings (9/4) - 5 points An initial drawings of the assignment in due on September 4th at the start of class. These initial drawings should be shared in the class discord before the start of class. These drawings are not quick sketches, or quick jottings of ideas. These drawings should be the final result of many rounds of thinking and sketching. These drawings should depict you device from many different angles. They should, at minimum, show your object from a perspective, side and front view. We are sketching in preparation for modeling. You should be as precise as possible even though our ideas will develop. Additionally, the drawings should describe the materials you imagine for your object. Lastly, the should begin to think of the environment, although minimal, the object will be rendered in. Our renders will be be mostly of our object, however, the space around our object should provide additional context. Completed Object Model (9/16) - 5 points You will have two in-class working sessions to get help with modeling your object. Although your object need not be finished at the end of class on September 11th, it must be completed by September 16th. This completed model will have clean topology including even edge loops and quad topology. A screen shot of your completed model should be posted to discord before the class it is due.
