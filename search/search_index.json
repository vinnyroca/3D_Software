To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however, our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students and Instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another.

A dream object can be anything. It could quite literally be an object from your dreams, a normal object turned strange and disturbing, or it might be an object of your own lucid invention. Perhaps, it is a device that only you can operate. Perhaps, it is a familiar object distorted through memories. Perhaps, it is an object you are trying to remember. Perhaps, it lives in a mountain far away, as large as a redwood tree, silently recording the patterns of constellations.</p> <p>If a dream object is anything, however, it is not a normal object. It is not a basketball, or a cup, or a shoe, or a house, or a boat, or a gun. If it were a real thing, it has changed. It has become something else; or, it was never recognizable at all.</p> <p>To decide on your dream object, think of its context. We will be taking inspiration from Victor Burgin's Afterlife. What do we notice about Afterlife? It consists of \"pages.\" It consists of text. It consists of images. Some rendered, some not rendered. But, what is most important is that the text contextualizes the images, and the images contextualize the text. Separate, they point to two different directions. Together, they create a context. It should be noted, Victor Burgin is a serious guy, very serious. We look to him for form and structure, but his tone is not a requirement. </p> <p>Your final assignment will have text and it will have images. Some of those images will be rendered. Others, if you would like others, might be photographs, scans, or any other set of pixels. Using whatever text and image editing software you like, be it Photoshop, InDesign, PowerPoint, or others, you will create a PDF of any dimensions. In this PDF, some pages will be empty. In this PDF, some pages will have images. Some pages will have text. No page will have both. At least 5 of these pages will have renders of your dream object. In other words, you will need to produce 5 renders of your dream object for this assignment. Each of these renders will be different, and describe something different about your dream object. If you wish to create additional renders of places or other objects, do not stop yourself. At least 4 of these pages should have text. As for the text, it might describe a story, tell a lie, give us commands, state a prayer, describe a dance, or anything in between. But, importantly, the text and images together will form a context. At least two of the pages should be blank. Use these blank pages thoughtfully. Some housekeeping: there should be a title page. (You may refuse this last requirement if you like.)</p> <p>Some options on how to begin:</p> <ul> <li>Dream, see and record what emerges.</li> <li>Don't dream, see and record what emerges.</li> <li>Daydream, see and record what emerges.</li> <li>Write some words, see what images emerge.</li> <li>Think of some images, see what words emerge.</li> <li>Think of yourself standing there, holding this thing in your hand, or, perhaps it is a thing in front you, larger than the horizon, or, perhaps it is as small as a pea, right under your foot. Oh no, it's attacking someone. Oh wait, it's not moving at all. Oh look, it is trying to tell you something. Oh wait, it cannot speak. This thing is your dream object.</li> </ul> <p>Another context: This class. We have just learned the fundamentals of hard surface modeling. Creatively, this gives us limitations. There are many things we do not know how to do, yet there are many things we already know how to make. Start there, start with what we have learned and what we know. What can you make? How can you make that more complex, interesting, inspiring, disturbing, compelling? With this in mind, like all things, this assignment will be made one step at a time, piece by piece.</p> <p>Periodically, we will share these pieces (more information on that below).</p> <p>However, there is one rule. And, under no circumstances should this rule be broken:</p> <p>Up until our critique day, in which we will all gather and share what we have been working on, your text, and thus your context, will be a secret. We might see your dream object, examine its textures, but we will not know its world, its story, its ambitions, or its dreams. Up until our crit, it is a dream of your own to ponder, build, and imagine.</p>"},{"location":"dreamobject/#pieces","title":"Pieces","text":"<p>This project will be broken up into a series of project pieces that all have their own due date.

Use the bridge tool with 1 level of divisions.  </li> <li>Use the Target Weld tool to seal up the bottom.
