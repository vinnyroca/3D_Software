Through weekly assignments, critical readings, and projects, students will engage with 3D software as a technical tool, artistic medium, and cultural object. This course introduces foundational skills in modeling, rendering, and animation using Maya and Zbrush, alongside exploration of additional software. Weekly discussions, readings, and presentations will critically engage with 3D software\u2019s cultural, social, economic, and political dimensions. The ideas and skills taught in this course will set a foundation for future coursework in game design, animation, video art, digital fabrication, and media studies. Learning Outcomes The objective of this course is to introduce foundational technical skills in 3D software and contextualize this knowledge within the cultural, social, economic, and political impact of modeling, rendering, and animation technologies. Through projects, assignments, discussions, reading responses, technical tutorials, and lectures, students will achieve the following learning outcomes: Technical proficiency in modeling, rendering, and animating using 3D software. Ability to analyze the role of 3D software in media art. Ability to analyze software as cultural, historical, and technical objects. Gain critical knowledge of history, theory, and cultural impact of 3D software. Ability to craft expansive media art projects using 3D software. Course Outline 1. Introduction 2. Modeling Software In this module, students will be introduced to the fundamentals of Autodesk Maya. Additionally, students will be provided an overview of the field of software studies, with a particular focus on the study of media production software. 3. Modeling History In this module, we will look at the origins of 3D modeling research and software. We will explore how this early history continues to shape 3D modeling and our understanding of digital objects. Further, we will continue our exploration of the techniques of modeling by looking at how we can manipulate components to create more complex 3D models. 4. Modeling Vision In this module, we will explore how space, materials, and objects are understood by processes of computation and software. We will compare this computational process to our experiences of the world to consider the drawbacks and affordances of the imperfect simulation of 3D software for artists. We will develop technical and critical knowledge for discussing how this historically situated and imperfect simulation continues to impact our culture in the present. Additionally, we will make use of historical technical standardizations within Maya to learn about texturing and image-based modeling. 5. Modeling Objects In this module, we will explore how the history of modeling objects has shaped both further computer graphics research as well as our contemporary understanding of digital objects. We will explore the disconnect in 3D modeling between geometry and material to explore 3D modeling as an imperfect simulation. Additionally, we will continue to develop our technical skills by learning the fundamentals of creating materials and producing rendered images of our 3D scenes. 6. Modeling Artists 7. PROJECT ONE CRIT 8. Modeling Knowledge In this module, we will explore how models in the academy, from protein models to detailed models of Rome, have changed how knowledge is formed and produced. We will consider how we can use models to generate knowledge, as well as explore the limitations and criticisms of conducting knowledge experiments with software. We will also consider how 3D modeling has been used as a tool of resistance to protect vulnerable communities. Additionally, we will begin experimenting with ZBrush to explore the potential of organic modeling to create abstract and representational models.

Is the conceptual idea behind the assignment supported by the technical and artistic decisions made by the student? Concept Does the student comprehend the scope of the assignment? Is the student able to communicate their ideas clearly? Does the student demonstrate comprehension of the concepts covered in class? Is the student able to articulate the concepts behind their work? Generosity Does the student exhibit insight, criticality, and risk-taking in their work? How much sensitivity and critical insight does the student display towards personal assignments and in critiquing their peers\u2019 work? Participation As this course includes in-person discussions and critiques, active participation and attendance make up 20 percent of students\u2019 final grade. All students are required to participate actively during the discussion periods, which will be facilitated using each student\u2019s reading responses. Students more than ten minutes late for class will be marked as late. Three late marks will result in an unexcused absence. More than two unexcused absences may, at the instructor\u2019s discretion, affect the final participation grade. All critique and presentation classes are mandatory. If you anticipate missing a critique or presentation class or expect to have more than two absences during the course, inform the instructor as soon as possible. Reading Responses Reading responses will be graded on the level of engagement the student has with the text. Is the student connecting the text to other readings or experiences? Is the student engaging with the text through questions, disagreements, or new lines of thought? As reading responses are essential to the discussion section of the course, late reading responses will not be accepted. Artist Presentations Artist presentations will be evaluated on the group\u2019s research, comprehensiveness, and clarity of the oral presentation. Does the research demonstrate that the students carried out extensive research practices when exploring the artist\u2019s biography and practice? Does the student use the themes of the course to contextualize the artist\u2019s work within 3D software? Do the students include citations for the sources of their presentation?","title":"Syllabus"},{"location":"#syllabus","text":"LOCATION: Scripps College, Steele 229 TIME: Tuesday and Thursdays 10:00 - 12:30 INSTRUCTOR Vinny Roca, Scripps College Email: vroca@scrippscollege.edu Office hours: By appointment; Tuesday 1:30 - 2:30","title":"Syllabus"},{"location":"#course-description","text":"This interdisciplinary introductory course examines the history, theory, and techniques of 3D software.

You can navigate to the search menu on the bottom of your screen and search for \"Maya.\" Maya Loading Screen This will open you to the Maya homepage where we can create a new project by pressing new. You might notice that we need to keep tabbing back and forth between our tutorial and our Maya interface. Since in the lab we are only using one monitor, lets use Windows default split screen feature to create a divided screen. Click on top bar of your Maya interface and hold the Windows Key and then tap the Left Arrow Key. Release the Windows Key and you should then see the option to click our Browser to have the two screens side by side. By click and dragging on the dividing line between the two screens you can change the amount of your screen each window takes up. This class website has flexible scaling so feel free to make the browser as small as you like. We'll be using this technique for the remainder of this class so refer back to this section if you forget the order of operations. Maya Interface My Maya interface Although the Maya interface seems very confusing at first, as we move through the course you will notice that your navigation of buttons and menus will become more intuitive. Our readings for this introductory module will introduce software studies through an examination of Maya's interface. To keep things simple, we will cover parts of the interface as needed for different parts of the course. As a continuous reminder, as an experimental arts course we are not looking for technical mastery , we are looking to understand Maya/3D software in general artistically and critically. View Panel In the center of our screen we have our view panel . This is where we can view 3D objects and manipulate them in real time. Although we are just starting, begin to consider the relationship between the view panel, which shows a live 3D view, and the various data points around this central portion. How is a 3D model both represented as a real-time image and data? You might see four view panels as shown below: Four view panels If you do not see four panels, hover over your main panel and tap the space key. Each of these view panels represents a different way of viewing our model. To make things easier, lets create a basic 3D model (called a polygon primitive ) to see how an object appears in each view port. Click on the icon of the cube within the Poly Modeling Shelf located in the upper right corner of your screen. In the center of our screen, we should now see our cube four, each time from a slightly different perspective. Each of these view ports represents a different way of viewing our model. Four view with Cube (I have zoomed in on the cube slightly) We can infer what each of these view panels are displaying based on the name at the bottom of each quadrant. The image below shows the name of the perspective view port (persp). While the other view panels show the cube from the top, front and side position using orthographic projection. We'll learn a bit more about the technology of projection later on in the course but what we need to know for now is that these view panels are showing the two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional object. Perspective Projection: a method for projecting a 3D object onto a 2D picture plane to approximate how a 3D object might be viewed by a camera IRL. Orthographic Projection: a method for projecting an 3D object to make all lines parallel. You might think for now of isometric projection used in many video games.
