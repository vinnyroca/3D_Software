Ability to analyze the role of 3D software in media art. Ability to analyze software as cultural, historical, and technical objects. Gain critical knowledge of history, theory, and cultural impact of 3D software. Ability to craft expansive media art projects using 3D software. Course Outline 1. Introduction 2. Modeling Software In this module, students will be introduced to the fundamentals of Autodesk Maya. Additionally, students will be provided an overview of the field of software studies, with a particular focus on the study of media production software. 3. Modeling History In this module, we will look at the origins of 3D modeling research and software. We will explore how this early history continues to shape 3D modeling and our understanding of digital objects. Further, we will continue our exploration of the techniques of modeling by looking at how we can manipulate components to create more complex 3D models. 4. Modeling Vision In this module, we will explore how space, materials, and objects are understood by processes of computation and software. We will compare this computational process to our experiences of the world to consider the drawbacks and affordances of the imperfect simulation of 3D software for artists. We will develop technical and critical knowledge for discussing how this historically situated and imperfect simulation continues to impact our culture in the present. Additionally, we will make use of historical technical standardizations within Maya to learn about texturing and image-based modeling. 5. Modeling Objects In this module, we will explore how the history of modeling objects has shaped both further computer graphics research as well as our contemporary understanding of digital objects. We will explore the disconnect in 3D modeling between geometry and material to explore 3D modeling as an imperfect simulation. Additionally, we will continue to develop our technical skills by learning the fundamentals of creating materials and producing rendered images of our 3D scenes. 6. Modeling Artists 7. PROJECT ONE CRIT 8. Modeling Knowledge In this module, we will explore how models in the academy, from protein models to detailed models of Rome, have changed how knowledge is formed and produced. We will consider how we can use models to generate knowledge, as well as explore the limitations and criticisms of conducting knowledge experiments with software. We will also consider how 3D modeling has been used as a tool of resistance to protect vulnerable communities. Additionally, we will begin experimenting with ZBrush to explore the potential of organic modeling to create abstract and representational models.

You can navigate to the search menu on the bottom of your screen and search for \"Maya.\" Maya Loading Screen This will open you to the Maya homepage where we can create a new project by pressing new. You might notice that we need to keep tabbing back and forth between our tutorial and our Maya interface. Since in the lab we are only using one monitor, lets use Windows default split screen feature to create a divided screen. Click on top bar of your Maya interface and hold the Windows Key and then tap the Left Arrow Key. Release the Windows Key and you should then see the option to click our Browser to have the two screens side by side. By click and dragging on the dividing line between the two screens you can change the amount of your screen each window takes up. This class website has flexible scaling so feel free to make the browser as small as you like. We'll be using this technique for the remainder of this class so refer back to this section if you forget the order of operations. Maya Interface My Maya interface Although the Maya interface seems very confusing at first, as we move through the course you will notice that your navigation of buttons and menus will become more intuitive. Our readings for this introductory module will introduce software studies through an examination of Maya's interface. To keep things simple, we will cover parts of the interface as needed for different parts of the course. As a continuous reminder, as an experimental arts course we are not looking for technical mastery , we are looking to understand Maya/3D software in general artistically and critically. View Panel In the center of our screen we have our view panel . This is where we can view 3D objects and manipulate them in real time. Thought: Although we are just starting, begin to consider the relationship between the view panel, which shows a live 3D view, and the various data points around this central portion. How is a 3D model both represented as a real-time image and data? You might see four view panels as shown below: Four view panels If you do not see four panels, hover over your main panel and tap the space key. Each of these view panels represents a different way of viewing our model. To make things easier, lets create a basic 3D model (called a polygon primitive ) to see how an object appears in each view port. Click on the icon of the cube within the Poly Modeling Shelf located in the upper right corner of your screen. In the center of our screen, we should now see our cube four, each time from a slightly different perspective. Each of these view ports represents a different way of viewing our model. Four view panels with Cube (I have zoomed in on the cube slightly) We can infer what each of these view panels are displaying based on the name at the bottom of each quadrant. The image below shows the name of the perspective view port (persp). While the other view panels show the cube from the top, front and side position using orthographic projection. We'll learn a bit more about the technology of projection later on in the course but what we need to know for now is that these view panels are showing the two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional object. Perspective Projection: a method for projecting a 3D object onto a 2D picture plane to approximate how a 3D object might be viewed by a camera IRL. Orthographic Projection: a method for projecting an 3D object to make all lines parallel. You might think for now of isometric projection used in many video games or architectural drawings. Isometric Projection in Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 - Image: Giant Bomb Now that we have a slight understanding of what we are looking at in our view panel, let's begin to dive into the relationship between our object and our scene. Cartesian Coordinate Space You might remember from your math classes learning about unit space, or what is more formally known as Cartesian Coordinate space (named after Ren\u00e9 Descartes). This is a simple coordinate system where, generally, each whole number is marked in a grid structure. You can see a simple example below with some points marked using the common (x,y) notation with x being the horizontal axis and y being the vertical axis. The important thing to know here is that Maya, and all 3D programs, make use of this coordinate space to visualize the location of models within our scene. The only difference from the image above is that instead of making use of a 2D x,y space, in Maya we use a 3D (x,y,z) space. In our Maya interface, we should see four view panels. Let's hover over our Perspective view panel and tap the space key to maximize this panel. We should see our cube highlighted with a green outline. If not, we can click on our cube. Finally, press the W Key on your keyboard. We'll talk more shortly about what this hot key does. This should show the Gizmo on our cube. UI TIP: Press the + or - key to change the size of your gizmo The Red Arrow points in the direction of the positive X Axis , the Blue Arrow , the positive Z Axis , and the Green Arrow , the positive Y Axis . NOTE: Different 3D software represent the coordinate space differently. While Maya uses the Y Axis to represent the vertical direction, some software use the Z Axis. What we can infer is that our cube, being in the center of our grid, is at the (0,0,0) position, also known as the origin point. We can see a numerical representation of our object in the coordinate space by looking at our Channel Box . Channel Box The Channel Box with our Cube selected. Our cube is named pCube1 (the first polygon cube in our scene!) The Channel Box is UI panel that allows us to quickly see information about our model. The Channel Box is most commonly used in animation to edit various aspects about our models quickly, but it is also a great descriptor of basic information about our model. We can notice that our Channel Box is separated into different values: Translate : The position of our object. Rotate : The rotation of our object. Scale : The size of our object. Visibility : Whether or not our object is visible in the scene (we'll touch on this later in the course.) To start, try inputting some values into of of the Translate Channels to see how it affects our Cube. UI TIP: If you click on a channel such as TranslateX and see it highlight, you can click and drag your middle mouse key to smoothly change the values of the channel. Notice how changing the channel values of Translate directly affects the position of our object within our scene. Now let's try the opposite. Make sure you can still see the translate gizmo on your cube by clicking on your cube and pressing the W Key . Then, click and drag on one of the arrows to translate your cube in the view panel. Notice how the corresponding channel values change as you translate your cube. Translating our Cube UI TIP: If you click and drag on the plane between two axis, this will move your object along two axes simultaneously. Also notice that our last click axis is highlighted yellow. By clicking on this highlighted plane, we can move our object along multiple axes Now, that we have moved our object around a bit, we might notice that it is hard to see how our object is exactly moving from our single viewing perspective. Let's return our Cube to the origin point by entering in 0 for Translate X,Y, and Z in our channel box and begin to discuss view panel navigation. Navigating around our View Panels One of the most important UI interactions with Maya in navigating around the 3D space of our perspective view panel. Luckily, view port navigation in Maya is quite simple and only uses our Alt Key and Mouse Buttons . ZOOM (Alt + RMB): First, let's try zooming into our cube. Hold the Alt Key and Right Mouse Button and begin dragging in the vertical or horizontal direction. You will notice that dragging on the positive Y and positive X zoom us out, while dragging on the negative Y and negative X zoom us in. Zooming In and Out ROTATE (Alt + LMB): Next, let's try rotating around our cube. Hold the Alt Key and Left Mouse Button and begin dragging in the vertical or horizontal direction. Notice the different behaviors between dragging vertically and horizontally. Rotating around our Cube PAN (Alt + MMB): Lastly, let's try panning around our scene. Hold the Alt Key and Middle Mouse Button and begin dragging in the vertical or horizontal direction. Panning allows us to focus on different parts of our scene. Panning around our Scene UI TIP: If you loose track of your object in your scene or if you want to focus on a particular object, you can click on any give object and press the F Key to focus on that object. When you focus on an object and then rotate your camera, you will notice that the camera will rotate around the particular focused object. NOTE: What is actually happening behind the scenes when we pan, rotate and zoom, is that we are moving a camera called \"persp\" (from which our View Panel gets its name) changing the properties of this camera. You can click on this camera in the left side of your screen in the Outliner (which we will cover shortly) and edit properties such as the Focal Length of your persp camera in the Channel Box. persp camera made visible! NOTE: In our orthographic view panels, we are only able to pan and zoom. Essential Object Manipulation Now that we know the relationship between our object, the coordinate system and the channel box, as well as how to navigate around our view port, we can now discuss basic object manipulation using Translate , Rotate and Scale . Translate (W): We have already covered a bit about translate, but now lets go in a bit deeper to learn what this tool actually does. If we click on our cube and again press the W Key we can notice that one of the menus on the left highlights. Tool bar showing our Selection, Translate, Rotate and Scale Tools Although we can click on this button on the left, it is best practice to begin memorizing essential Maya hot keys. Try translating using the gizmo while also rotating and panning your camera. Rotation (E): We can also rotate objects in our scene by pressing the E Key on our keyboard to bring up our rotation gizmo. By click and dragging on a particular axis, we can rotate our object. Notice in our Channel Box we are rotating our object in terms of Degrees . If we enter 45 in RotateY in our channel box, our cube with turn 45 Degrees around its Y Axis. UI TIP: By pressing and holding the J Key before rotating, we can precisely rotate our object by 15 Degree increments. Scale (R): Lastly, we have scale. This allows us to change the size of our object. Lets reset all our channel box values by entering zero for all translate and rotate channels. UI TIP: If you want to change the value of more than one channel in your channel box, you can click and then shift click to select all the values your want to change. Then enter the value you want all the channels to have and press enter. Below, I click on TranslateX then shift click on RotateZ and then enter 0 to reset all channel values. Now we can press the R Key to bring up our scale tool. We can notice in our Channel Box, the scale values by default are equal to 1. This value works as a multiplier. For example, a scale value of 2 will be twice our original scale. UI TIP: Notice that the Move, Rotate and Scale tool are all next to each other on your keyboard. Allowing easy access between the tools using W, E, and R. NOTE: By default Maya uses centimeters for its unit of measurement. Thus, our cube is currently 1cm by 1cm by 1cm. By changing a scale channel value to 2, our object would then be 2 cm on the particular axis. Our grid coordinate by default also uses centimeters. We can scale our object uniformly by clicking and dragging on the yellow cube in the center of our scale gizmo. Notice all all Scale Channel values change by the same amount. We can also scale our object on each axis by clicking and dragging on an axis of the scale gizmo. UI TIP: If we don't want to see our Move, Rotate, and Scale gizmos, we can press the Q Key on our keyboard to change to our selection tool (also right next to our Move, Rotate, and Scale tools on our keyboard). Outliner Before we move onto playing around with making some basic models using objects, let's talk about how we can keep track of objects within our scene. First, let's clean up our scene by deleting our original cube. Click on your Cube and then press the Delete Key on your keyboard. Then lets add in a new cube using the Poly Modeling Shelf . Notice that when we add in the cube a new object appears in our Outliner on the left side of our screen. The Outliner lists all of our objects within our scene. Notice we have all of our cameras as well as our newly created \"pCube1\". We can also rename our objects within our Outliner by double click on the name of our object. Lets rename our cube to \"Base\" The Outliner can be used for finding objects within our scene as well as selecting objects by clicking on them. Modeling a Basic Chair Although we are not really diving into the complexities of model today, let's use what we have learned in class so far to build a basic chair. Scale and Move the base object of your chair to become a seat. Let's create a new cube using our Poly Modeling Shelf and name it \"Leg\" within our Outliner. Scale and move your new cube to be in the position of a chair leg. We can now duplicate this leg. We can do this by clicking on our leg, activating the Translate tool with the W Key and then holding Shift and dragging on an axis. You might now notice it is hard to see the edges of your different objects. In our view panel, we can display the edges of our model. This is the \"wire frame on shaded\" view mode. Now let's use another method of duplication or cloning for our legs. Click and then Shift+Click on the other leg. Then press Ctrl+D on your keyboard to duplicate the two models and drag them over to the correct position. Finally, lets click on our base, press Ctrl+D to duplicate it. Than Rotate it while holding the J Key to snap it 90 Degrees before moving it to the back of our chair. Pivot Points and Snapping Now that we have made our chair you might notice that things are looking a bit wonky! This is okay, 3D models don't always need to be precise. However, since our focus today is on learning the basics before we break them, lets get a bit more precise with how we are moving our objects in our scene. To do this, we will make use of the pivot point and snapping . If we click on one of the legs our our chair and activate our Translate tool, well notice that the pivot point of this object is in the very center. The pivot point is the position where our object translates, rotates and scales. By moving this pivot point we can change how our object behaves. Pivot point at the center of the chair's leg Our goal is to change our pivot point in such a way that we can align the corner of our chair leg with the corner of our chair base. The Two corners we want to align To do this, we'll need to move our pivot point to be on the correct corner of our leg, then align that to be at the corner of the base of our chair. Moving Our Pivot and Snapping Let's move our chair leg down to make some more space. Press the D Key on your keyboard to bring up our pivot controls. To snap our pivot to the corner of our leg we can hold down on the V Key on our keyboard (short for vertex, which will get to next class). And click and drag on the yellow center of our pivot to move it to the proper corner. We can turn off the pivot tool using the D Key , make sure our Translate tool is on and press and hold the V Key again to snap our object to the bottom corner of our base by clicking and dragging on the center of our Translate gizmo. Finally, let's repeat these steps with the other parts of our chair.

NOTE: Different 3D software represent the coordinate space differently. While Maya uses the Y Axis to represent the vertical direction, some software use the Z Axis. What we can infer is that our cube, being in the center of our grid, is at the (0,0,0) position, also known as the origin point. We can see a numerical representation of our object in the coordinate space by looking at our Channel Box .","title":"Cartesian Coordinate Space"},{"location":"1_MayaInterface/#channel-box","text":"The Channel Box with our Cube selected. Our cube is named pCube1 (the first polygon cube in our scene!) The Channel Box is UI panel that allows us to quickly see information about our model. The Channel Box is most commonly used in animation to edit various aspects about our models quickly, but it is also a great descriptor of basic information about our model. We can notice that our Channel Box is separated into different values: Translate : The position of our object. Rotate : The rotation of our object. Scale : The size of our object. Visibility : Whether or not our object is visible in the scene (we'll touch on this later in the course.) To start, try inputting some values into of of the Translate Channels to see how it affects our Cube. UI TIP: If you click on a channel such as TranslateX and see it highlight, you can click and drag your middle mouse key to smoothly change the values of the channel. Notice how changing the channel values of Translate directly affects the position of our object within our scene. Now let's try the opposite. Make sure you can still see the translate gizmo on your cube by clicking on your cube and pressing the W Key . Then, click and drag on one of the arrows to translate your cube in the view panel. Notice how the corresponding channel values change as you translate your cube. Translating our Cube UI TIP: If you click and drag on the plane between two axis, this will move your object along two axes simultaneously. Also notice that our last click axis is highlighted yellow. By clicking on this highlighted plane, we can move our object along multiple axes Now, that we have moved our object around a bit, we might notice that it is hard to see how our object is exactly moving from our single viewing perspective.

When you focus on an object and then rotate your camera, you will notice that the camera will rotate around the particular focused object. NOTE: What is actually happening behind the scenes when we pan, rotate and zoom, is that we are moving a camera called \"persp\" (from which our View Panel gets its name) changing the properties of this camera. You can click on this camera in the left side of your screen in the Outliner (which we will cover shortly) and edit properties such as the Focal Length of your persp camera in the Channel Box. persp camera made visible!

Then enter the value you want all the channels to have and press enter. Below, I click on TranslateX then shift click on RotateZ and then enter 0 to reset all channel values. Now we can press the R Key to bring up our scale tool. We can notice in our Channel Box, the scale values by default are equal to 1. This value works as a multiplier. For example, a scale value of 2 will be twice our original scale. UI TIP: Notice that the Move, Rotate and Scale tool are all next to each other on your keyboard. Allowing easy access between the tools using W, E, and R. NOTE: By default Maya uses centimeters for its unit of measurement. Thus, our cube is currently 1cm by 1cm by 1cm. By changing a scale channel value to 2, our object would then be 2 cm on the particular axis. Our grid coordinate by default also uses centimeters. We can scale our object uniformly by clicking and dragging on the yellow cube in the center of our scale gizmo. Notice all all Scale Channel values change by the same amount. We can also scale our object on each axis by clicking and dragging on an axis of the scale gizmo.

To do this, we will make use of the pivot point and snapping . If we click on one of the legs our our chair and activate our Translate tool, well notice that the pivot point of this object is in the very center. The pivot point is the position where our object translates, rotates and scales. By moving this pivot point we can change how our object behaves. Pivot point at the center of the chair's leg Our goal is to change our pivot point in such a way that we can align the corner of our chair leg with the corner of our chair base.

In short, polygon objects are made up of three components: Vertices Edges Faces (sometimes called Polygons or Polys) Before software like Maya, Polygon Models were made by manually entering the location of vertices into a computer. Often modelers and researchers would trace objects and use specialized equipment to find the distance between vertices. Image from Image Objects by Jacob Gaboury Image from Image Objects by Jacob Gaboury Today, Polygonal Modeling involves manipulating these three components to create a wide variety of shapes. We are no longer limited to jamming polygon primitives together and now can create objects of our own design. Let's start by loading the practice file for today's class. Download Here. After the file is open, you'll notice on the right side of the screen there are a variety of layers. Layers all us to store different models on different layers of our scene. We can begin by turning on the visibility of our \"FACES\" layer by pressing the left-most button on the layer. Faces To navigate to faces, hover over your model and press the Right Mouse Button . This will bring up our Marking Menu . Marking Menus are context specific and allow us to get easy access to all the functionality of Maya. You don't click in the marking menu. Instead, however over the tool you want to access and release the right mouse button. UI TIP : You can use the same marking menu to return to Object Mode when you are done selecting on faces. Modify We can modify faces using the translate, rotate and scale tools. Use the translate, rotate and scale tools to create the object on the right. Delete We can also delete faces to allow for interesting shapes. Use the Translate and Delete tools to make the shape on the right. Normals Notice that the inside of our box is black, while the outside is gray. This is because faces have not thickness to them, they are infinitely thin! The direction the face is facing is the normal direction. We always want the normal direction to be facing outwards towards our camera. We'll learn more about the complication of normals as the course progresses, but for now, let's reverse the normals this model so that the inside of model is correctly facing the camera. To select all the faces on our model: Click on the model Right click navigate to Face Mode Press Ctrl+Shift+A to select all the faces. Next, we can press and hold Shift+RMB over our model. This will bring up a marking menu of contextual tools related to the component mode that we are in. In our case, it will bring up tools related to faces. To reverse our normals: Press and hold Shift+RMB over our model Navigate to Face Normals Navigate to Reverse Normals Extrude The most important tool associate with faces and for poly-modeling in general, is the Extrude tool. The extrude tool allows us to extrude out additional faces from our model to build out geometry. We can open the extrude tool by using the Shift+RightClick marking menu and then navigating to Extrude Face . Thickness In the pop-up box for the tool, we can use the Thickness parameter to extrude the selected face. Let's use this parameter to match the model on the right. Offset The Offset parameter allows us to inset our face. Let's use the extrude tool twice to make the model on the right. Keep Faces Together The Keep Faces Together parameter will allow us to extrude faces separately. Extrude all the faces on the cube with Keep Faces Together off. UI TIP : Press Ctrl+E with a face selected to bring up the extrude tool. Hot Keys Lastly, we can use the Shift Hot Key with our Translate, Rotate and Scale tools to quickly extrude. Hold Shift while moving and scaling the top face to make the model on the right. UI TIP: If you have trouble rotating around face or seeing a face clearly, press the F Key on your keyboard to focus on a particular face. The clip below shows what happens when you zoom in on a face. Face Selection Lastly, let's go over a common face selection technique. This allows us to select a large number of faces next to each other at once. Let's follow the below steps to make the model in the \"face selection\" area. Create a new cylinder in your scene and move it over to the \"face selection\" area. UI TIP :Use the Shift+RMB marking menu with nothing selected to quickly create new objects. Change the number of sides on your cylinder to 16 to match the object on the right. UI TIP : We can change the amount of sides our cylinder has in the Channel Box . Next let's select everything but the top and bottom of our cylinder. We'll do this by selecting on face and then, hold Shift , double click on one of the faces next to our selected face. Then, we'll press Ctrl+Shift+I to reverse the selection, followed by the Delete Key to delete our top and bottom faces. Edges Each face is typically made you of four edges. A face with four edges is refereed to as a quadrilateral or a \"quad\", for short. It is best practice when modeling to ensure allow your polygons are quads - in other words, each polygon should have four edges. 4 Sides, Quad = Great! 3 Sides, Tri = Okay in some situations. 5+ Sides, N-Gon = Should rarely appear on model and will often cause errors The structuring and flow of edges to create faces on a model is topology . Face Topology of Mrs.Incredible from The Incredibles. Notice on her ear we see what appears to be a tri. If we look closely, however, we can see it is actually a quad with four sides Selecting Edges To enter edge selection, we can hold the Right Mouse Button over our model and navigate up to edge. Edges attached together in an unbroken line are called an Edge Loop. We can select and edge loop by double click on an edge that is part of that loop. Edges adjacent to each other, but not connecting in a loop, are called an Edge Ring. We can select an edge ring by clicking on an edge and then Shift+Double Click on an adjacent edge. To Delete an edge loop we use the special hotkey, Ctrl+Backspace . This hotkey will delete the edge loop and the vertices associated with it. Note in the gif below, we should not delete a single edge, as this will make and N-Gon. Instead, we should delete the whole edge loop. Delete the center edge loop to match the image on the right. Modify We can modify edges using our Transform, Rotate, Scale and Extrude tools. Use the Shift Hot Key to extrude with Transform and Scale to create a model similar to the low polygon glass. Make sure to select the full edge loop at start. Notice that our glass is one-sided, meaning, it has no interior. We can use the Extrude tool in Object mode to give some thickness to our glass. We'll extrude inward to keep the profile of our glass the same, so we'll need to flip the normals of all our faces to be pointing outwards toward the camera. Make sure when you extrude the glass that the faces on the interior of the stem don't overlap. Insert We can add edge loops to our model using the Insert Edge Loop Tool . Hold Shift+RMB over the model and navigate to the Insert Edge Loop Tool. Hold Click + Drag on an edge to insert and position an edge loop. Release Left Click to place the edge loop. Insert edge loops to create the model on the right. Press Q to exit the insert edge loop tool. We can also add edge loops to our model that are equally distant from one another. For this object, I want to be able to add in some basic windows and a door. Lets start by opening the Insert Edge Loop Tool Settings. Hold Shift+RMB over the model and navigate to the small box next to the Insert Edge Loop Tool. This will bring up the tools settings. In our settings, we can toggle on Multiple Edge Loops to insert a specific number of loops. Let's add 6 vertically and 7 Horizontally. We can also extrude our windows and door to match the model on the right. UI TIP : When we turn on a tool such as Insert Edge Loop Tool, that tool stays on until we exit it. The easiest way to exit a tool is by pressing the Q key to activate the selection tool. Bridge Lastly, we have the bridge tool. The bridge tool allows us to create a face using two edges. To use the bridge tool, we can click on two edges and navigate to Bridge holding Shift+ Right Click We can bridge multiple edges together by selecting an equal number of edges opposite one another. Select the remaining six open edges and bridge them together.
